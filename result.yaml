  :title: Getting the Most Out of Sustainability Report Interviews - Triple Pundit
  :text: |
    Tweet
    By Elaine Cohen
    As a Sustainability Reporting Consultant, one of the regular, most fascinating features of our role is the gathering of information within a company about advances in sustainability performance.
    This often requires interviewing many individuals, mainly executives and managers. Sometimes this is challenging, as many people in many organizations don’t quite understand why they have been selected for a “Sustainability Report Interview” or what their role has to do with sustainability. Often they are just doing their job, and the connection between their day-to-day and sustainability is not explicit. Others are ready for the conversation, which is often an annual event, and even look forward to it. Some even do a little preparation! As we work with several companies working with different reporting cycles, I find that that I am part of such conversations almost all the time as a regular feature of my job. I find that it’s also one of the most useful parts of our job, as far as the organization is concerned, although they might not realize it.
    In an ideal world, where Sustainable Business Strategy is articulated, implemented, communicated and part of the way of life in any company, you would expect that everyone would know their connection to the sustainability agenda and why it’s important. The reality is that, even in companies where sustainability is just about as embedded as you can get, people still have trouble seeing linking their their roles to the organization’s overall positive impacts. The Sustainability Report Interview is one tool among several that can help reinforce and refresh sustainability thinking and drive action in the organization. 
    There are several reasons that these conversations are always important.
    The Sustainability Report Interview is an Art Form rather than just another plain ole conversation. It takes a certain knowledge and skill to perform a Sustainability Report Interview well and get the most out of a short conversation.The Sustainability Report Interview has several objectives and becomes a powerful (and fascinating) part of the reporting process. It can make a big contribution to advancing sustainability awareness, understanding and practice in any company, including smaller companies. We always try to interview as wide as possible a range of individuals in any company, in order to gather and cross-validate information and ensure we have a rounded understanding of performance, activities and issues. This is the nuts and bolts of sustainability reporting. It is often overlooked as a value-adding element in the sustainability reporting process.The key things we try to do in Sustainability Report Interviews are:
    Gather Insights and Information
    This is the clear, stated objective of any Sustainability Report Interview. We aim to gather insights and information about sustainability performance in the course of the reporting year, within the scope of the interviewee’s role and responsibilities. The idea is to distill the precise contribution to social and environmental impacts (positive and negative), from a range of information about the interviewee’s role and performance. At this point we do not restrict ourselves to specific information that we think may be relevant to the sustainability report. Rather, we aim to gain deep understanding of what was done and why and an appreciation of the context in which such activities were undertaken. We look for performance, stories, case studies and future plans and targets.
    Identify Sustainability Practice 
    The very process of the interview causes the interviewee to think about her or his role through a sustainability lens. If you ask most managers in most organizations outright what have they done to advance sustainability, they don’t come up with very much. At best, they may start talking about some volunteer activity or other. By asking them about their business activities, a skilled sustainability report interviewer can identify those areas which are relevant from a sustainability standpoint. For example, a Logistics Manager might say that she restructured routing processes to improve delivery efficiency. She is happy to have saved costs while maintaining customer service. When we ask about the environmental impact, she may know the fuel savings which were needed to calculate the cost benefit, but she has probably not thought of the greenhouse gas emissions impact of logistics efficiency improvement. The minute we ask about this, and try to identify environmental metrics for this approach,  advising that  a saving of, say, 1,000 gallons of fuel is equivalent in GHG emission terms to planting and growing over 220 seedlings for ten years, a light-bulb (LED, of course) suddenly illuminates the imagination of the Logistics Manager. The next logistics efficiency project she undertakes will measure both cost and environmental benefit. Suddenly the Logistics Manager has become a Sustainability Manager as well.
    Identify More Information Sources 
    Sometimes, it takes a while to get to the right person who can provide detailed information. Often, you start with more senior people and have them identify highlights or areas for further investigation. They will generate a list of people to talk to within the organization. In other cases, there may be clues about possible external stakeholders that may be able to make an important contribution to the report. A manager might say, “We led a great project last year. We hired an external consultant to help us.” Or possibly, “We partnered with a trade association or non-profit organization to complete this.” As the credibility of reporting is often enhanced with the inclusion of external stakeholder voices, the interview is a good source of potential additional experts who can provide content to enrich the report.
    Increase Sustainability Awareness
    A more subtle role of the Sustainability Report Interview is to help increase awareness of sustainability and its business value. In some cases, organizations may not have a declared sustainability strategy, and may not have communicated sustainability widely within the organization. Many managers may be performing sustainably without even realizing it and often do not associate their positive activities with a higher purpose of sustainability. They may even think there is something wrong with claiming to be sustainable when all they really wanted to be was efficient. Often, people might say, apologetically: “We saved energy for cost reasons, not for sustainability reasons.” This is a great opportunity for the interviewer to explain the link between operational efficiency and sustainable business, and reinforce to the interviewee that, whatever it’s called, positive social and environmental impact may be the (additional) result of their actions. This connects interviewees to a higher purpose.
    Empower the Sustainability Leader
    In many organizations the CSO or Sustainability Leader or CSR Reporting Manager, or whatever she’s called, participates in the interviews. This is a great opportunity for the interviewer to help the Sustainability Leader build understanding, awareness and relationships. Often, the Sustainability Report Interview might be the first time the Sustainability Leader has actually had a conversation with certain managers in the organization. Often, the Sustainability Leader comes away from such conversations having learned something new. This empowers the Sustainability Leader with new information and new contacts which help her drive the sustainability agenda. It also ensures that skills are developed within the organization and not condemned to oblivion in a file of an external consultant.
    Reward Commitment and Action
    A Sustainability Report Interview is an unofficial way to recognize those who are doing good work in sustainability. Although it is not the role of the external consultant to do this, in practice, reinforcement that a manager’s work is meaningful and even report-worthy is a helpful bonus that the consultant can bring.  The fact that we show an interest, want to know more, ask about challenges, successes and outcomes, and provide the possibility that the manager’s story might get published, are all massive motivating factors. In some cases, people want to tell their story so that it can help others. We give them a stage to do so. This is invaluable in helping create and embed a culture of sustainability.
    Support Internal Communications 
    You’d be surprised, or maybe you wouldn’t, especially in large organizations, how some managers don’t know what the organization is doing or even what their colleagues are doing. Many managers don’t read the company sustainability report (evidence of a shortfall in internal communications programs?) and many are surprised to hear for the first time that the company they work for actually does a whole lot more to advance social and environmental benefits than adding zeros to a profit statement. Knowing this engenders pride in the company and pride in themselves. The process of engaging in conversation with a wide range of managers in an organization makes sure they are getting the message. In the course of an interview, you don’t just listen, you share, you update, you tell people why sustainability is important. After a good Sustainability Report Interview, both interviewer and interviewee know more about the organization and its sustainable practices. The process is an effective way to open up communication channels and get more people on the same page.Having established herewith that Sustainability Report Interviews are a fabulous tool, not just for reporting, but to advance sustainability, organization development, communications, engagement and motivation, not all of them are a piece of cake. In conducting interviews, the interviewer needs to be skilled in handling a wide range of reactions to the interview summons.
    Let’s discern TEN types:
    The Let’s-Get-This-Over-With Type: 
    Characterized by: Politically-correct manager, maybe senior, not particularly interested in sharing, has a big team of people who can tell us what we want to know, has a hard stop in 15 minutes.
    Making the most of it: Thank the manager, state up front it will only take 15 minutes. Cut to the chase, extract the headlines, and note the additional people s/he recommends talking to first. Then ask the manager where s/he feels the biggest business contribution was from her or his department in the last year. That will earn you at least another ten minutes and provide clues for sustainability activities.
    The What-Am-I-Doing-Here Type:
    Characterized by: Totally disinterested manager, really doesn’t understand how her or his role is connected to sustainability, doesn’t understand what all the fuss is about, but was urged to cooperate by The Boss.
    Making the most of it: Thank the manager, say it won’t take too much of her/his time. Ask first about business achievements in the past year. Look for sustainability themes in the business achievements, and probe further in those areas. If there’s nothing, let it go and move on.
    The Talk-To-Someone-Else Type:
    Characterized by: Manager understands and supports the sustainability agenda, but is simply not the right person to talk to. Sustainability projects are more related to the work of other colleagues.
    Making the most of it: Thank the manager and ask, anyway, what the manager has achieved in the past year and what benefits this has brought to the company. Then continue as for the What-Am-I-doing-Here-Type above.
     
    The New-Kid -On-The-Block Type:
    Characterized by: New manager, recently joined, never participated in a Sustainability Report Interview before. Happy to provide data and information but is not familiar with sustainability and doesn’t know if s/he will be able to help.
    Making the most of it: Thank the manager and wish her or him good luck in his/her new role. Explain about the Sustainability Reporting process, why it’s important and offer some highlights from the last report. Explain why the new manager’s role is important for sustainability.
    The We-Donated-$500-To-Charity Type:
    Characterized by: Manager who still believes CSR is about charity, and is very very proud of the $500 donation the department made last month.
    Making the most of it: Thank the manager and confirm that a $500 is a fabulous donation. Then ask the manager to tell you what her/his biggest achievements at work have been during the past year.
    The Glad-You’re-Interested Type:
    Characterized by: Interested manager, but not quite sure how her/his role fits with sustainability, s/he is just doing what s/he knows best in the interests of the business. Very glad that someone is taking an interest.
    Making the most of it: Thank the manager. Take an interest in specific projects mentioned. Explain how they are relevant to sustainability. Create the connection between sustainability and the manager’s role.
     
    The Ready-and-Waiting Type:
    Characterized by: Manager happy to engage, hasn’t prepared anything in particular, but knows the drill and is quite willing to have the conversation and be helpful.
    Making the most of it: Thank the manager,  ask about key objectives, goals, targets and achievements in the past year. Ask about what didn’t work so well. Confirm the relevance of this manager’s activities to the sustainability agenda.
     
    The I’ve-Done-My-Homework Type:
    Characterized by: Prepared manager, been there, done that, knows the drill, knows what you will ask, has done homework and prepared a list of activities and events in anticipation of the call.
    Making the most of it: Thank the manager. Lap it up.
    The Help-Me-Focus Type
    Characterized by: Manager who is excited to share but simply can’t focus on what you are asking. Shares great detail about helping a local sports club build a new clubhouse but fails to address sustainability issues in the core business.
    Making the most of it: Thank the manager. Listen to the story. Compliment the manager. Then ask about her or his work activities. See the Ready and Waiting Interview.
    The Enjoyed-Our-Talk Type:
    Characterized by: Interested manager, does best to explain everything about progress made in sustainability projects and enjoys doing so. Confirms that s/he enjoyed the conversation.
    Making the most of it: Thank the manager. Lap it up.If your reporting process does not include Sustainability Report Interviews, something’s amiss. If you are not getting the MOST out of these interviews, you should reevaluate how you they are conducted. If at the end of the interview process, you have not enriched the organization while gaining relevant information (both good news and less good news), you need to think it through. It’s a large investment in time and money, it should work.Some of the most rewarding outcomes of Sustainability Report Interviews for me are when people say:
    I am glad you are interested in what I do
    I really enjoyed the conversation
    I learned something new
    That’s given me an idea, I am going to follow up.
    When there are a lot of these reactions, I know we are going to be able to help deliver a great Sustainability Report!
    So, here’s to 2014, the Year of the Sustainability Report Interview!
    Happy 2014!
    PS: Maybe I should post next about what NOT to ask in a Sustainability Report Interview. I could probably write TWO posts about that. HAHA.

    A holistic approach to the issue of sustainability within building design is necessary in order to provide a greener future, according to P&T – the 14th largest architecture company in the world.
    Director Stephan Frantzen and sustainability expert Ahmed Mosa met with Middle East Architect to outline how P&T – which has its main offices in Dubai, Bangkok, Singapore and Shanghai, headquartered in Hong Kong - is tackling this increasingly important subject.
    “We are quite simply living beyond the regenerative capacity of our planet,” said Frantzen. “And buildings are a major contributor to carbon emissions: 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, along with 12% of potable water and 30% of the total energy.”
    Mosa said the emphasis on environmentally friendly building in Dubai’s Expo bid and the adoption of a Green Building Code were steps in the right direction.

    But he added subjects such as transport and infrastructure must also be taken into account.
    “There is no use having a sustainable building if people have to drive many kilometers to reach it,” he said.
    Frantzen said geographical and climatic conditions need to be taken into consideration during the building design.
    “It’s very important to understand the difference between having a certified building and a sustainable building. Rating systems are only tools which will not necessarily lead to a genuine sustainable building, especially with lower certification levels.
    “Most rating systems are based on, or inspired by, American and British standards. As a consequence, these systems fail to recognize local traditional buildings because the ratings systems emerged in industrialised countries that depend heavily on mechanical systems.
    “Therefore they do not consider the local historic, climatic, economic, technological and social context.”
    Mosa said the client needs to be involved from the beginning in the considerations about sustainability.
    “There has to be something in it for the client when sustainable factors are incorporated into a design,” he said. “This is of course crucial for life on the planet. But we need to offer something concrete that developers can see is beneficial to them economically and as a way to profile their company as a serious developer.”
    The company’s latest projects include new headquarters for the Liu Chong Hing Bank along Des Voeux Road in Hong Kong and a design institute in the city which uses solar energy for power and recycled material for flooring.
    Frantzen said an “integrated approach” is the way forward for sustainable design.
    “Our process is to facilitate the co-ordination between the design teams, the architects and the engineers from the early stages of a project,” he said. “At P&T we have an advantage being a multi-discipline firm with architects, structural engineers and MEP engineers where we share knowledge between our many offices.”

  :title: 4 Lessons in Sustainable Business from Nike's New Waterless Dye Technology
    - Triple Pundit
  :text: |
    Tweet
    Today’s story is about Nike ’s latest innovation – ColorDry technology which eliminating the use of water and process chemicals from fabric dyeing. The new technology, which Nike’s CEO Mark Parker described as a “manufacturing revolution”  was introduced earlier this month at the opening of a water-free dyeing facility at FENC, the company’s Taiwanese contract manufacturer.
    This is a great story to close 2013 with as this isn’t just another story about an innovative technology introduced by an innovative company – this story exemplifies the current path of sustainable business, including its opportunities, difficulties and challenges.
    What does it mean exactly? Let me explain through four lessons we can learn from this story:
    1. Making the status quo obsolete – we live in this weird reality where externalities manage to shield manufacturing processes from real world problems like increasing water scarcity. The result is inefficient and wasteful systems that somehow still dominate and shape the status quo.
    It’s not that hard to figure out this won’t be for long – just think about these figures provided by Nike: on average, an estimated 12-18 gallons of water is needed to process one pound of textiles today. Industry analysts estimate that more than 86 billion pounds of polyester will be dyed annually by 2015. Multiply these figures and you get 1.3 trillion gallons of water that will be required just for the dyeing process of polyester. Does anyone believe the status quo can go on for long?
    Now, the question is what companies do it about it. Most companies seem to be waiting for some sort of external intervention, such as a hike in the price of water in order to start rethinking about these business as usual practices. Few companies are behaving proactively like Nike.
    Nike’s approach is based on creating better solutions that will become the norm not just because they’re sustainable but also as Hannah Jones, Nike’s VP of Sustainable Business and Innovation explains because they’re “better, easier and frankly more delightful to the consumer.” In this case, it is a technology that “reduces dyeing time by 40 percent, energy use by around 60 percent and the required factory footprint by a quarter. In addition, Kuenlin Ho, Executive VP at FENC explains “it’s also the most saturated, intense and consistent color we’ve seen.”
    Better quality, reduced costs, less dependence on constrained innovation – could you ask for better new norm? Probably not. Yet, my guess is that many companies suffer from a status quo bias and will be slow to adopt the new technology, no matter how advantageous it seems to be.
    2. The limits of technology – ColorDry uses recyclable CO2 to replace water, quite an impressive technology. According to the Oregonian , “Popular Science last year rated the technology among its “Best of What’s New” products.”
    Yet, let’s face it. Even such technology can take you so far. When it comes to many clothing items that Nike sells like t-shirts and pants most of the water  footprint is from the raw materials (especially when using water intensive materials like cotton) and consumer use phases. This is also true for energy use and climate change impacts.
    So while the manufacturing revolution is important, it is only one step on the long path to create a more sustainable economy. It’s important to note that Nike is also working on creating ‘materials revolution’ through LAUNCH , a strategic partnership between the company, NASA, USAID and the U.S. State Department. Yet, its most difficult challenge - changing consumer behavior - is still waiting to be revolutionized. I’m not sure technology will be helpful there, but hopefully Nike will use its other strengths to figure it out. Until then the revolution ain’t over.
    3. The fruits of collaborative long-term approach – “Nike has embraced a long-term perspective. Improving sustainability performance often involves heavy investment initially, with benefits being realized over a longer term,” Angharad Porteous and Sonali Rammohan write in new paper published by the Stanford Initiative for the Study of Supply Chain Responsibility . “Nike has also been focused on collaborative product and process design innovations focused on environmental sustainability,” they add.
    Collaboration and long-term view seem to work quite well for Nike and the case of ColorDry seems to be no different. First, the new technology follows Nike’s exploration of this technology for the past nine years and its 2012 investment in DyeCoo Textile Systems , a Dutch company that developed the first commercially available waterless dyeing technology.
    In addition, earlier this year IKEA announced that it will also invest in DyeCoo and Nike revealed that its strategic partnerships group, the Sustainable Business & Innovation Lab, worked closely with IKEA GreenTech throughout the investment process. “IKEA’s decision to invest in this technology signals an exciting step in cross-industry collaboration,” Jones wrote.
    Based on Nike’s experience this sort of an open innovation approach combined with the ability to think long-term and act patiently looks like an effective strategy. The only question is why don’t we see more companies adopting it as well?
    4. Innovation is the new CSR – ColorDry is not a one-time innovative achievement. It’s part of a unique business culture that was built in Nike, managing to do what so many companies still struggle to figure out – how to converge sustainability and innovation.
    A starting point occured in 2009 when the corporate responsibility function in Nike was redefined as the Sustainable Business and Innovation Team (SB&I) under the leadership of Hannah Jones. Made up of about 130 people, the SB&I team acts as a catalyst for sustainability companywide , leading sustainability strategy development and providing content expertise and consulting to teams companywide.
    Recently  Jones reported that  Nike “made some organizational changes and, as part of that, we’ve seen the Sustainable Business & Innovation function move to fully integrate with Nike’s Innovation function. It’s a significant signal of the value of having sustainability as a fundamental part of our innovation strategy.”
    This is not just about organizational redesign, but also about a new focus – “one of the lynchpins of the strategy is that over the last few years, we have really shifted our sustainability team from being a risk-management and reputation management agency to really also having significant R&D and innovation capabilities,” Jones says .
    The bottom line is that companies that want to make sustainability integral to their innovation and performance like Nike will need to rethink the way they address CSR and sustainability just like Nike did. Only then they might succeed like Nike.

    Victor Hu: "On the Path to Sustainability in 2014"
    Head edtech investment banker anticipates capital trends and data-driven personalization
    Victor Hu
    "...It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity..." (Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities)
    2013 has been, once again, both the best of times and the worst of times for education.  Consider some of the developments throughout the year:
    After the US K-12 system was decried by public and private sector leaders as a national security crisis last year, international test scores confirmed this year a "picture of educational stagnation," in the words of Education Secretary Arne Duncan. The impending application of Common Core with more rigorous academic standards has stoked widespread anxiety that the narrative of failure will only be extended further.
    In higher ed, aggregate student debt has ballooned past a trillion dollars, while unemployment and underemployment continue to plague the 54% of students who manage to graduate in 6 years (not to mention the 46% who do not). Colleges and universities face shrinking public funding, declining enrollment and contracting endowment returns - and in some cases deeper, more existential questions.
    Globally, publicly traded education companies - particularly for-profit postsecondary companies - muddled through another year of generally underperforming market indices, with a handful of markets such as Brazil emerging as rare exceptions.
    Yet look more closely at the bottom half of the glass, where there were positive signs to be seen everywhere.
    With the rise in property tax receipts, states and districts are finally spending again on education content and technology, with some markets set to double next year. Spurred on by compelling research, new publicly funded initiatives are underway to support greater early childhood education.
    Educators and policymakers alike are demonstrating a new openness to technology, innovation and experimentation; the flipped classroom, competence-based learning, personalized learning and other similar concepts considered newfangled or far off only a few years ago have all entered the mainstream of academic dialogue and are being seriously studied and in some cases implemented.
    Access to some of the best instructors at some of the best institutions is now, for the first time, a reality for billions of people.
    The private markets have never been more robust, with new generations of edupreneurs and investors partnering to tackle some of education’s most intractable problems.
    Against the backdrop of these divergent storylines, what will 2014 bring? Below are five observations on what we can expect to see in the new year:
    Capital
    After averaging around $260 million for the ten years ending in 2011, venture and growth investment in education technology and services spiked to over a billion dollars in 2012, and surpassed that figure again in 2013, prompting many in the industry to cry “bubble” with reference to the first edutech crash in the aftermath of the original Internet implosion.
    The difference this time, however, is that many of the companies tapping the private markets have proven product-market fit, and some have already achieved meaningful scale. The majority of edutech companies raising sizeable growth rounds recently have demonstrated the ability to serve their market segments in sustainable ways. Expect the capital trend to continue in 2014 as more and more companies seek to apply software and internet technology to transform different parts of the education value chain.
    Consumerization
    Private consumer spending on education, especially in supplemental education such as tutoring or test prep, has generally been much more robust outside the U.S. than inside, and typically focused on niche market segments. Nonetheless, with the increasing number of convenient and low-cost alternatives for extending learning beyond the school environment and bringing quality educational products and services into the home, 2014 has the potential to bring significant growth to consumer education markets globally.
    It has never been easier to beef up on coding, do a deep dive on web design, learn some Chinese vocabulary, buy some adaptive math courseware for your third grader or even give your brain a memory workout. Various content providers are leveraging brands such as Curious George through edutainment and smart games. Overseas, areas such as language learning and IT training remain large growth markets where private consumer spending typically generates strong Return on Investment in terms of increased employment opportunities and long-term earnings potential.
    Online Everywhere
    Online education has been around for decades, but historically has been the domain of smaller education market segments, nontraditional learners and non-elite institutions.
    We have now passed the inflection point, and online is ready to go mainstream in every part of the education continuum in 2014.
    Next year, we'll be five years into the famous prediction by disruptive innovation gurus Clay Christensen and Michael Horn that online education will account for half of all high school courses delivered by 2019. In higher ed, elite universities have joined in, likely causing any institution who has not yet implemented an online strategy to race to do so. In the meantime, a variety of online learning platforms have proliferated, with diverse content and monetization strategies. After causing a media swoon in 2012, MOOCs have moved quickly beyond Gartner's "peak of inflated expectations"; some have already plunged into the "trough of disillusionment," and others are beginning the long, steady climb up the "slope of enlightenment" toward product and business model sustainability.
    Tech & Media Join the Party
    With close to 80 million K-20 students in the US alone and over a trillion dollars in aggregate market size (with over $40 billion in technology and curriculum spend by US schools), education is already a strategic end market for the world’s largest technology providers. Given the massive changes fast approaching in educational content delivery, assessment and even basic pedagogical models--all of which will be accelerated by Common Core--strategics see an opportunity to bring their technologies and brands to a growth market, while hopefully developing lifelong relationships with the next generation of technology users. Acquisitions by News Corp., Intel, Discovery, Amazon and others are likely only the beginning of a broader trend by technology and media companies to broaden their footprint in the education space, a trend that is likely to accelerate in 2014.
    Data-Driven Personalization
    The digitization of content and assessment and the increased usage of new online platforms are creating a treasure trove of data that many believe hold the keys to the future of education: truly personalized learning powered by powerful computer algorithms that adapt content to fit individual competencies and learning styles.
    A number of companies have been putting resources into what is universally conceded to be a devilishly difficult problem to solve, one that requires massive scale both in content and users, not to mention highly sophisticated technology. However, the applications across K-12, higher education and corporate training are extensive, addressing markets worth hundreds of billions of dollars. We expect some of the early implementations to begin to create measurable outcomes in 2014 that will let educators and investors know whether the promise of personalization is likely to be realized in the foreseeable future.

    Sustainability leaders recognised in New Year’s honours list 2014
    Tuesday, December 31st, 2013 By Nicky Stubbs
    The Met Office’s chief scientist Julia Slingo and sustainable design expert Kevin McCloud top a long list of sustainability leaders recognised in the New Year’s honours list for 2014.
    Published twice a year, the honours list aims to give recognition to “extraordinary” Britons who have dedicated their efforts to a specific service or cause.
    Prof Julia Slingo, chief scientist at the Met Office, has been made a Dame of the British Empire for her services to weather and climate science. In 2008, she was appointed the first female president of the Royal Meteorological Society. Throughout her career, she has dedicated much of her time to researching the impacts of climate change and has worked closely with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
    Meanwhile, Kevin McCloud, TV presenter and designer, is given an MBE for his services to sustainable design and energy saving property refurbishment. McCloud is most notable for presenting the Channel 4 series Grand Designs, but has been heavily involved in WWF’s One Planet Living campaign, promoting sustainable living.
    McCloud’s company, Hab Housing, featured in Blue & Green Tomorrow’s Guide to Sustainable Homes 2013 . It also recently broke the record for equity crowdfunding , raising £1.9m on the online platform Crowdcube.
    Other notable people to be honoured by the Queen include Ian Cheshire, chief executive of Kingfisher, the parent company of DIY chain B&Q. He was given a knighthood for services to business, sustainability and the environment. Cheshire was recognised by the Guardian  in 2012 for his work in the sustainability field and was named the “sustainable business leader of the year”.
    OBEs are given to Graham Jukes, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, for services to environmental health in the UK and abroad, and John Doggart, chairman of the Sustainable Energy Academy (SEA), for services to sustainable energy technologies and energy efficiency. Doggart, like McCloud, spoke to Blue & Green Tomorrow for The Guide to Sustainable Homes 2013 .
    Meanwhile, entrepreneur Karren Brady, who has long worked for gender equality in business, receives a CBE. Brady has also been touted as a Conservative parliamentary candidate for 2015, but there have also been rumours of her standing to become mayor of London.

    New sustainability network launched for CFOs
    The Prince of Wales’ Accounting for Sustainability Project has launched a sustainability network for chief financial officers and is looking to expand this network globally in 2014.

    As the impact of environmental and social concerns become more relevant to companies’ financial performance, some of Europe’s most prominent businesses have put their CFOs on the line in a new network that aims to lead the financial community in responding to these new realities.
    The Chief Financial Officer Leadership Network, comprising 16 major British and global companies in Europe, was launched on Dec 12 at the 8th Accounting for Sustainability (A4S) Annual Forum.
    The A4S Project was set up by The Prince of Wales in 2004.  
    “CFOs have a vital role to play in making sure their businesses thrive, not just today, but tomorrow and into the future.  The bottom line is that sustainable business equals good business.  I am therefore delighted that the A4S Chief Financial Officer Leadership Network will play a key role not only in communicating why sustainability makes business sense, but how to start accounting for it,” said Prince Charles.
    The companies in the network are Anglian Water, BUPA, Burberry Group, British Land, The Crown Estate, Danone, Royal DSM, Marks & Spencer, National Grid, Sainsbury’s, SSE, South West Water, Unilever, United Utilities, Walmart EMEA and Yorkshire Water.
    “
    CFOs have a vital role to play in making sure their businesses thrive, not just today, but tomorrow and into the future.  The bottom line is that sustainable business equals good business
    Prince Charles
    The move aims to mainstream this extended new role of CFOs in order to address the grey areas that remain unclear for many companies and give a boost to the deepening importance of sustainability issues into companies’ financial operations.
    John Rogers, co-chair of the A4S CFO Leadership Network and CFO of Sainsbury’s noted that what used to be seen as greenwash needs to become as natural to company finance teams as it is to CR departments or even NGOs.
    “I’m pleased to be co-chairing this significant new initiative and urge my counterparts in business and public organisations to contribute their skills and experience to the A4S CFO Leadership Network,” he said.
    But more critical for companies would be on how their CFOs must work to reflect these issues and make it easier and clearer for stakeholders and investors absorb these new factors. In particular, the CFO group would look into ways to improve their modeling of future risk and uncertainty.
    The group’s Charter has set out clear objectives: support CFOs in gaining new competencies; share insights to accelerate progress towards accounting for sustainability; develop new tools and methodologies on how to embed sustainability into the internal decision making processes; and engage investors and other stakeholders.
    But for the first year, the network expects tangible achievements such as a guide that would improve transparency in decision making including ways to embed sustainability into capital expenditure appraisal, and improving methodologies for the measurement and valuation of natural and social capital.
    The network said it is looking to expand globally during 2014.

    UFI Reports on Status of Sustainability in Exhibitions
    By Matt Alderton
    View Comments
    Although the exhibition industry overwhelmingly acknowledges the importance of sustainability, most exhibition organizers have yet to adopt sustainable business practices, according to UFI, the global association of the exhibition industry, which this month published a new report assessing the state of sustainability among exhibition venues and organizers.
    According to the report, “Status of Sustainability in the Exhibition Industry,” 99 percent of exhibition organizers, venues and suppliers agree that the exhibition industry is concerned with the issue of sustainability. And while 39 percent of all companies have implemented sustainability across their organization, only one in five (20 percent) exhibition organizers has done so.
    Likewise, 64 percent of exhibition organizers are aware of the ISO 20121 standard for sustainable event management, yet only 34 percent believe the standard is relevant to the industry or their company. This compares to 80 percent of venues that are aware of the standard, and 67 percent of venues that believe it’s relevant.
    There are many reasons for the gap between appreciating sustainability and implementing it, according to UFI, which documented as companies’ biggest challenges lack of interest/commitment from stakeholders (56 percent), complexity (31 percent) and cost (27 percent).
    To facilitate further adoption of sustainable practices among exhibition organizers, UFI’s Sustainable Development Committee has developed a series of actions to inform, educate and promote sustainability among its members, including the development of an online education program and a new awards program recognizing best practices in sustainable development. Additionally, it has released a template designed to assist companies in developing sustainability reporting structures.
    “Most people would agree that the world currently suffers from an economic crisis ... or an environmental crisis ... or a social crisis ... or perhaps all three. This is why a sustainable approach — including environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and socio-political sustainability — represents a viable solution to an urgent situation for a growing number of individuals, companies, public and government bodies,” UFI President Chen Xianjin says in the introduction to UFI’s report. “The exhibition industry can and should play a role in implementing sustainability.”

    The first half of our top 20 stories of 2013 is dominated by calls for new narratives and fresh thinking on sustainability. Photograph: Tony Stone
    Our most popular 20 stories from 2013 reveal something of a patchy year for sustainable business. Decades into the sustainability debate and sometimes it can still feel as if little changes, but there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic.
    The first tranche of our top stories asks for new sustainability narratives and a move away from thinking that incremental changes have any hope of solving some of the huge challenges we face. There are calls to fundamentally change business - whether that means moving away from unsustainable mass tourism, embracing a new model of local supermarket or watching the progress of a coalition of business leaders aiming to drive systemic change.
    What do you think of the first half of our top 20 stories? Are there lessons to be learned and reasons to be positive? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

     AIPH Joins Floriculture Sustainability Initiative
    by International Association of Horticultural Producers (AIPH)
    Posted: Monday, December 30, 2013 at 3:25PM EST
    The International Association of Horticultural Producers (AIPH) is now formally a member of the Floriculture Sustainability Initiative (FSI) following approval at the FSI Board meeting on 12 December.
    FSI is an initiative formed of a collaborative group of stakeholders within the ornamental horticulture supply chain. With the help of funding from the Sustainable Trade Initiative the body is developing an Equivalency Tool for comparing and evaluating industry certification schemes from around the world. Sustainability issues are at the heart of what FSI is looking at so the focus of the Equivalency Tool will be the environmental and social standards within certification schemes.
    Commenting on AIPH’s involvement in FSI AIPH Secretary General, Tim Briercliffe said “Growers around the world work hard to comply with the demanding requirements of many certification schemes. It is important that the industry addresses social and environmental issues and certificated growers pride themselves on the sustainability standards they achieve. The large number of certification schemes that exist for flowers and ornamental horticulture can be confusing for all those involved in the trade. The new Equivalency Tool, under development by FSI, will enable all parts of the supply chain to compare sustainability standards between schemes which must be a good thing.”
    He continued “There is always a danger however that growers become forced to introduce practices and procedures which help tick boxes during an inspection but do nothing to genuinely enhance sustainability and simply reduce business productivity. Through the AIPH Environment and Plant Health Committee we will ensure that the views of growers are fully represented during the development of FSI. We look forward to working with the FSI team, driving sustainability standards and promoting best practice.”
    FSI Executive Officer Jeroen Oudheusden commented “We are pleased to have AIPH on board with FSI and look forward to working with them as the initiative progresses. It is important that the voice of growers is properly heard in this process and we know that AIPH will ensure it is.”
    The Equivalency Tool will be launched by FSI at IPM Essen in January 2014.

    International Association of Horticultural Producers (AIPH)
    AIPH is a co-ordinating body representing horticultural producers' organizations all over the world. It was set up in Switzerland in 1948 to stimulate the international marketing of flowers, plants and landscaping services. Currently membership consists of 26 organisations from 19 countries. For further details visit www.aiph.org.
    Floriculture Sustainability Initiative (FSI) – www.FSI2020.com
    Why the FSI?
    The sector is held back from mainstreaming sustainability in the floriculture sector and increasing demand for sustainable flowers by a number of particular barriers. History has shown that individual fragmented projects have had impact and at the same time have not reached a mainstream level. Therefore the sector as a whole has decided to take responsibility and create an initiative that is desired, created and maintained by the sector and its stakeholders. The will to make sustainability mainstream and a license to deliver is carried throughout the sector and by creating an overarching structure the FSI can face up to the challenges of the barriers and other possible challenges in the future.
    The spirit of FSI:
     International agenda & vision on mainstream ambition
     Joint action & proactive strategy on current and future sustainability issues
     Strong member commitment & accountability on agreed activities & results
     Business driven initiative with full membership & strong participation of CSOs and other stakeholders.
     Light organizational structure
    All actors are working together towards a healthy, vital and sustainable floricultural sector.
    FSI mission: What do we want to be to make our dream come true?
    FSI wants to be an international, floricultural platform working together in a pre-competitive manner towards a sustainable sector by providing incentives and tools for its members.
    Ambition: What do we want to achieve?
    FSI wants to achieve that 90% of the internationally traded flowers and plants by FSI members will be sustainably produced by 2020.

    Glen Jenkins: Sustainability is core mission of local group
    Saved
    Enlarge Photo
    In 2007, the city and county of La Crosse each became eco-municipalities, a program that promotes ecologically, economically and socially healthy communities. We used a book called “The Natural Step” as a guide.
    During the summer of 2007, study circles were held to educate community members on “The Natural Step” framework. About 40 people participated in these groups.
    A small group of people started meeting to discuss the possibility of forming an organization to implement the plan. In October 2007, a diverse group of community members were invited to participate in a focus group. A leadership team used the focus group’s information to develop a vision, purpose, business and mission for a new organization.
    Those events led to the creation of Coulee Partners for Sustainability. The group’s mission is simple — “Living respectfully, responsibly and reverently with one another and with the Earth.”
    From that time on, we have worked to provide educational opportunities for the greater La Crosse community related to the issues surrounding sustainability.
    For the past six years, Coulee Partners for Sustainability has raised funds and organized the Earth Fair held each April at the Myrick-Hixon EcoPark. The event takes more than 250 volunteers and the support of many businesses and organizations. There are many activities, workshops and demonstrations, along with more than 80 vendors, including the first-of-the-season farmers market. In the past two years more than 2,000 people have taken part in these activities.
    Coulee Partners for Sustainability also sponsors free lectures, discussion groups and film screenings for the community.
    The group’s members have helped with the formation of the Hillview Urban Agriculture Center, and with help from Western Technical College, are building a greenhouse for community members and Western students.
    Each fall, a harvest dinner is served to celebrate the accomplishments of Coulee Partners for Sustainability and our community to become more sustainable and responsible for the Earth’s resources. Each year, a local business and community member are recognized for their contribution to the sustainability effort.
    Glen Jenkins is a member of Coulee Partners for Sustainability. For more information, go to cpslax.org.

  :title: 'Flagged Bill: HB 38 Sustainability Amendments, Rep. Arent - Utah Political
    Capitol'
  :text: |
    December 31, 2013
    Rep Patrice Arent (Democrat – Millcreek)
    Representative Patrice Arent (Democrat – Millcreek) is continuing her years-long push for higher pollution control standards this legislative session with HB 38 – Sustainability Amendments.
    The bill, quite simply, would require the governor to tap a Sustainability Director, who’s role would be to work with other state agencies to create sustainable programs and policies designed to reduce the environmental impact the state makes on our environment.
    Presumably, the Sustainability Director would work to upgrade automotive fleets, upgrading office equipment to be more energy efficient, and implementing more comprehensive recycling programs designed to divert waste from the state’s landfills.
    The impact of comprehensive sustainability plans could be quite large. Utah’s state budget is expected to be over $11 billion in 2015, accounting for roughly 10 percent of total production within the state, decreases in pollution and increases in efficiency standards could have a great impact on the states overall pollution impact. By placing someone at the head of the operation, real, comprehensive action could take place.
    This is part of a suite of bills Arent intends to run that are designed to improve Utah’s environment. Arent has already published  HB 19 – Electric Vehicle Battery Charging Service Amendments, and other potential bills listed include “Clean Air Programs,” and “Joint Resolution Endorsing Tier III Standards for Air Quality.”
    Over the years, Arent has become a leader in fighting Utah’s dirty air. In the past she has passed bills that require government agencies to report their plans to reduce air pollution and report on such progress. She has also attempted to pass legislation that would have created a task force specifically designed to address air quality.
    During the 2012-2013 inversion season, there were a total of 35 mandatory “no burn” days and 14 voluntary “no burn” days in Salt Lake and Davis County—equating to roughly one in four days during the winter season when the air posed a risk to citizens health. As of December 12th, Utah County has had three mandatory no burn days, while Salt Lake, Davis, and Cache have had two.

    .@CETCodeGreen Releases Groundbreaking #CSR Report http://3bl.me/k5h82z #sustainability
    Multimedia from this Release
    Triple Pundit
    By Elaine Cohen
    Caesars Entertainment Corporation recently published its 2012 CSR and Sustainability Report . This is a groundbreaking report. (Disclosure: I assisted with the development and writing of this report. But don’t let that fool you. It is still groundbreaking.)
     
    Why is it groundbreaking? Because it’s first in many ways:
    It’s the first Sustainability Report from a U.S. based gaming-entertainment corporation which is in accordance with  GRI G4 Core  level guidelines.
    It’s one of the first G4 Core reports published anywhere in the world (there are less than 20 at the time of writing).
    It’s the first G4 report from any U.S. corporation which is published in line with G4 Core level guidelines (two other U.S. companies published G4 “referenced” reports, one non-profit published a G4 Core report and a public agency published a G4-referenced Sustainability Review, making Caesars the first corporation to go public with Core).
    It’s the first Sustainability Report to be published after having passed the brand spanking new G4  Materiality Matters check . The G4 Materiality Matters check opened for business on December 2nd, and Caesars was one of the first organizations to apply. Actually, I believe this is a FIRST IN THE WORLD G4 CORE Materiality-Matters-checked-by-GRI publication! Correct me, please, if I am wrong, but I have not seen any other report published that can make this claim.
    I am convinced. Groundbreaking it is. It has been a great pleasure and privilege for me to assist such a fabulous organization committed to not only reporting, but to living its sustainability journey with passion and purpose.
    I’ll be honest and say that I was a little (a lot) (ok, a ton) skeptical when GRI announced the Materiality Matters check. In this check, GRI promises to analyze responses to 11 materiality disclosures, and ensure that the responses meet the reporting requirements, are correctly located in the report and, equally as important, are easy to locate. I thought this check was probably not worth bothering with. How hard can it be to get a few disclosures in the right place? I felt that the check should include confirmation of the location of all the Disclosures on Management Approach and the Performance Indicators that are required reporting once a company has declared its material Aspects. In fact, I still feel that this would be an important addition to help ensure the integrity of a report.
    However, my skepticism faded when I realized that there is room for error. GRI required us to make some modifications to the draft report in order to pass the Materiality Matters check. We had an incorrect page number in the index, an incomplete link to an external assurance statement and we needed to add “disclosure labels” in the body of the report to help the reader locate specific disclosures. Little things, but important ones for report users. And important for reporting companies, because in these little things lies a certain attention to detail that can make a report navigable, coherent and, most importantly, credible. In the end, I was pleased that the folks at Caesars Entertainment took the brave step of submitting their report to GRI scrutiny, and was entirely relieved when GRI delivered the  Materiality Matters icon .
    Over several months, I have come to know many of the Caesars people, and engaged with over 50 executives and staff in thousands of minutes of VOIP, landline, cyberspace and broadband. No, I didn’t actually get to  Caesars Palace  in person this time around, but I did feel that I was there in spirit as I enjoyed many spare minutes playing  Slotomania .
    One of the fascinating parts of this reporting process was the review of Caesars material issues – this was done in several meetings with managers within the company, and external experts from  World Resources Institute  and others. It was a great process, and resulted, I believe in a more rounded and balanced core of most material issues which formed the heart of the report content.
    Another thing that guided the structure and content of this report was the  Caesars Code of Commitment.  This Code was developed in 2000, and you don’t have to have a very long conversation with anyone at all at Caesars to realize that it’s the way they live their work. The four key pillars of the Code: commitment to employees, guests, communities and environmental stewardship helped create a perfect framework for Caesars’ material issues and the story of Caesars’ CSR and sustainability performance in the last year. Helping create Vibrant Communities is at the heart of this story, and the report demonstrates how Caesars makes a positive difference.I am sure you will want to go take a look at the report yourself, so I won’t spoil your fun. A few highlights, however, to whet your appetite, from Caesars’ accomplishments in 2012:
     
    Completion of 37 corporate efficiency projects with an investment of $3.5 million delivering nearly 24 million kWh energy savings per year.
    24 percent waste diversion from landfill, measured for the first time.
    41 percent of women in management roles.
    More than 3.6 million hours invested in employee training.
    Increase in customer satisfaction scores 2.56 percent, reaching the highest satisfaction levels in Caesars’ history.
    In 2012, 85 percent of Caesars gaming revenues were related to customers’ specific preferences, enabling Caesars to align special rewards with what customers wanted most. The hotel industry average was 56 percent.
    Caesars Entertainment takes a public stand on important issues to support vibrant communities and social justice, including supporting comprehensive immigration reform that both advances border security as well as streamlines the immigration process for those who are willing to work hard and complete the legal process.
    In 2012, in the U.S. alone, Caesars employees donated more than 130,000 hours to support local communities.
    Significant investment in Responsible Gaming with over 35,000 employees trained in Responsible Gaming tools in 2012 alone.
    By the way,  Caesars also publishes key data which reports the company’s contribution to helping develop Vibrant Communities in different states across the U.S.  So if you live in Arizona, Nevada, Mississippi or Pennsylvania, for example, you can download data that is specifically relevant to your community.
    And by now, you probably know what I am going to say next. Read the report. Give feedback.

    Idea Rebel Features Sustainability Kiosks in Canadian Shopping Center
    December 31, 2013
    The digital agency has installed two versions of its digital touch-screen kiosks in Saanich's Uptown shopping center.

    Idea Rebel has installed two versions of its digital touch-screen Sustainability Kiosks in Saanich, B.C., Canada's Uptown shopping center.
    The Vancouver, B.C., Canada-based digital agency was founded on green initiatives by Jamie Garratt, named Entrepreneur of the Year finalist for 2013 by Ernst & Young and winner of Business in Vancouver's Top Forty under 40. As a certified LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) building and a participant in the Car Share Program, it seemed natural to feature the Sustainability Kiosk in Uptown shopping center's main courtyard, the company said.
    Uptown shopping center was acquired by Morguard Real Estate — a company that revitalized the Victoria shopping center site with increased density, sustainability initiatives and LEED Neighborhood Development Gold multi-use development.
    There are two interactive kiosks: one for children and one for adults. The children's kiosk offers interactive games that teach power-saving, water-saving and recycling techniques. The adult kiosk showcases sustainability in households, on the road and in the shopping center. In addition, the kiosk features maps of nearby walking and biking trails, advocating shoppers to travel to Uptown by sustainable means.
    With these new kiosks, Idea Rebel said it continues to raise the bar in being environmentally responsible and spreading awareness of the importance of sustainability.

    A Look Back at 2013
    Economic and sustainability issues dominate Clarkdale year-end priorities
    Mayor Doug Von Gausig
    The Verde River @ Clarkdale project, a lease secured from Phoenix-based mining company Freeport-McMoRan in May gives the town a 90-acre river access point near Tapco that will serve as the upriver anchor park starting in 2014. Improvements to Tuzigoot were also made, including construction of a handicapped accessible path.

    The town of Clarkdale saw the year end with the completion of two major projects: The wastewater treatment plant, and the replacement of about 10,000 feet of steel and asbestos concrete water main that had been in use since the early 20th century.
    Mayor Doug Von Gausig said the civil union ordinance that went into effect just before the year's end was a huge milestone, along with many others that were reached during the course of the year.
    "The biggest, most important project finished this year was the completion of a new wastewater treatment plant, which will allow the town to become vastly more water-sustainable in the future," Von Gausig said.
    It's been a full year since the Sustainable Clarkdale Initiative led to the town becoming one of Arizona's solar communities, with solar electric and hot water installations on 5 percent of its homes. According to a year-end wrap up provided by Town Manager Gayle Mabery, another 43 homes have followed in 2013, bringing the penetration of solar to 10 percent in Clarkdale.
    Furthering the Verde River @ Clarkdale project, a lease secured from Phoenix-based mining company Freeport-McMoRan in May gives the town a 90-acre river access point near Tapco that will serve as the upriver anchor park starting in 2014. Improvements to Tuzigoot were also made, including construction of a handicapped accessible path.
    Kids at Clarkdale-Jerome School were able to enroll in a new Clarkdale Kids Conserve Program this year, the result of a partnership with the Verde Natural Resource Conservation District.
    A Walton Family Foundation grant is funding the development of a Water Resource Management Plan for the town. Since starting the project this year, the town has held community education workshops led by water experts and projecting water demand out to 2075.
    "In conjunction with the new plant, we are working on an ambitious new water management plan that (will) help us use our water more wisely and efficiently, and will finally give us the capacity to attract new businesses that have the same sustainable vision as Clarkdale," Von Gausig said.
    On July 1, the end of a 10-percent furlough that had been in place since Jan. 1, 2009, brought town employees back to 40 hours each week. Clarkdale's bond rating was upgraded to "AA" by Standard & Poors, and was the first in the state to report its finances to the state's transparency website.
    Colby & Powell CPA accountant Scott Graph has been auditing the town since 2009. During the Dec. 10 council meeting, he said Clarkdale was in a much better place financially than at the end of FY 2009, when the general fund was negative by $9,000.
    "It took a lot of good decisions over these years," Graph said during the meeting.
    This was the town's first full year with an economic development director on staff. Under Jodie Filardo, town codes were updated to increase business growth, the town adopted an economic development plan and two businesses joined the handful already downtown. Four Eight Wineworks opened in October, and the Copper Art Museum started officially giving tours on Dec. 1.
    The town was one of seven Arizona agencies to receive a four-year, $125,000 grant to fund a school resource officer at CJS under the U.S. Department of Justice's School Oriented Policing Services grant program.
    A new election cycle takes effect in 2014, eliminating March and May. Three members of the town council will have their terms extended until November, when the rest of the council is up for re-election.
    Looking to 2014, Von Gausig said community leaders are going to continue studying ways to "live within our means" when it comes to water, while promoting natural resources like the Verde River, the small-town atmosphere and scenic beauty.
    "The Clarkdale Water Management Study will help guide our decisions and discover new ways to become water-sustainable in the years to come," Von Gausig said. "Our greatest goal is to serve our citizens and businesses well without doing any further harm to the flows of the Verde River."

    African Minerals Development Centre, a New Project to Improve Sustainability On the Continent
    27 December 2013
    Africa:  Viral Load Tests 'Could Transform...
    The United Nations Development Programme has launched, together with partners, a new centre that will help countries to best use mining revenues for sustainable development. Currently based in Addis Ababa, the African Minerals Development Centre (AMDC), launched here by Esperanza Biaz, Mozambique's Minister of Mines, will help implement the Africa Mining Vision, which aims to ensure the extractives sector can boost social and economic development across the continent.
    The centre is co-sponsored by the Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the African Union Commission (AUC) and the African Development Bank (AfDB).
    The new hub will help implement the African Mining Vision, which aims to ensure Africa's mineral resources can support economic growth and development. It will translate that vision into practical solutions for reducing poverty and involving people in development.
    Experts and researchers will be made available to help countries implement the vision, advising governments, businesses and civil society organizations on issues such as licensing, geological and mining information systems, artisanal and small-scale mining and investments in diversification.
    Africa's mining, oil and gas sectors are thriving, thanks to high commodity prices and improved exploration technologies that have led to important discoveries. Nineteen out of 46 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have important reserves of hydrocarbons oil, gas, coal or minerals and 13 countries are in the process of exploring additional reserves.
    The extractives sector is expected to play an important role for development in many African countries, triggering growth in new and dynamic economic sectors and industries, as well as investments in jobs, infrastructure and basic social services.
    "The sector provides huge opportunities for sustainable development and poverty reduction if properly managed with the right mix of policies and enforcement systems in place," said Lebogang Motlana, the Director of UNDP's Addis Ababa-based Regional Service Center for Africa.
    Countries endowed with abundant pools of mineral resources are faced with a number of challenges, such as limited participation by marginalized groups like women, minorities and youths in extractive sectors, conflict over land and resources, environmental degradation and the creation of capital intensive economies that fail to create jobs and benefits for local communities.

    The growth versus environment narrative needs to change in 2014
    Tony Juniper hopes sustainability will be firmly on the political agenda in 2014 but fears the philosophy of growth at any cost will continue
    Jump to comments (…)

    The last year was not a landmark one for progress on sustainability here in the UK. The government has remained obsessed with short term GDP growth and the sense that policy and ambition for sustainability are in reverse gear is palpable.
    The prime minister's alleged call to "get rid of the green crap" rather sums up the dire circumstances now faced by those looking for progress in response to ever more certain scientific reports.
    Despite the reluctance of many ministers to even recognise sustainability challenges, never mind actually doing anything about them, positive progress is being made through some other routes. I suggested at the end of 2012 that 2013 would see progress in the collection, use and reporting of environmental and social information by companies to complement that which they provide about their financial performance. This has indeed been the case, with a number of initiatives, such as TEEB for Business , gathering considerable momentum. There is a long way to go on this, but at least this ball is now rolling.
    Looking forward to 2014, the UK will be in pre-election mode. This will be the time when environment and sustainability questions need to get back on the agenda. If this is to be the case in a way that leads to substantial manifesto promises, then it seems to me that the growth versus the environment narrative that has become so prominent among key ministers and media outlets needs to be effectively challenged and changed.
    This is not simple, but is doable. Conservation and environment groups, leading companies, commentators and economists could work to embed a different narrative, one that describes the social and economic benefits that could come through embracing sustainability. That is my hope. My prediction is less positive. I fear sustainability will remain at the margins of debate with a near total absence of leadership from politics and with the small group of leading companies struggling to maintain profitability in the face of competitors who favour business as usual.
    On the global stage too I fear 2014 will offer more disappointment than it does progress. Crucial will be Ban Ki-moon's Heads of State level Climate Summit at the UN in September. This attempt to get the outline of a climate change deal well in advance of the deadline in Paris in December 2015 could well be the world's last chance to avoid very damaging levels of climate change. The outcome from the UN climate talks in 2013 in Warsaw does not provide good foundations for rapid progress.
    Moving forward in 2014 will be a challenge, both domestically and globally. Where leadership will come from is not clear, and unfortunately neither is strong public demand for action. Under such circumstances, those who do get it need to find different ways to achieve impact. Whatever that might be, the first job is to change the narrative . While crude growth at any cost trumps sustainability, I don't believe we are going anywhere different any time soon.

  :title: 5 of the Biggest Healthcare Sustainability Stories of 2013 - Becker's Hospital

    5 of the Biggest Healthcare Sustainability Stories of 2013
    Written by Bob Herman ( Twitter | Google+ )  | December 26, 2013
    Here are five of the biggest stories from 2013 related to hospitals, health systems and sustainability initiatives.
    In September, Becker's Hospital Review released " 50 of the Greenest Hospitals in America ." The list, one of the only lists highlighting hospitals for their green efforts, garnered interest across the healthcare spectrum, which reinforced a growing trend: Environmental sustainability is a shared responsibility, and the healthcare sector has become the perfect poster child for the movement.
    Further proof of the rise of sustainability in healthcare came in April, when the Healthier Hospitals Initiative released its first annual report . HHI said incorporating sustainability initiatives helped its member hospitals reduce their environmental footprint, lower costs and improve patient health.
    After looking back at the past 12 months, here are five of the biggest stories from 2013 related to hospitals, health systems and sustainability initiatives.
    1. White House honors two healthcare leaders for sustainability efforts. In July, President Barack Obama and his administration named 11 people as "Champions of Change" for public health and environmental protection issues. Two of those champions are directly involved with hospitals: Jeff Thompson, MD, CEO of Gundersen Health System in La Crosse, Wis., and Gary Cohen, co-founder and president of Health Care Without Harm, Practice Greenhealth and HHI.
    In an exclusive interview with Becker's Hospital Review , Dr. Thompson and Mr. Cohen discussed what the event was like and how they were making a difference through their respective organizations.
    Mr. Cohen said "the event represented recognition of healthcare as a powerful frame for climate change. I think polls [show] that the best way to communicate to people about climate [change] is to make a link between extreme weather events and their health and the health of their families."
    2. Hospitals support President Obama's climate plan. The "Champions of Change" honors came soon after President Obama outlined several ways his administration plans to tackle climate change and reduce carbon pollution.
    Although the American Hospital Association did not directly comment on President Obama's plan, HHI and other public health organizations voiced support, saying: "We appreciate the president taking action to reduce carbon emissions and enacting other measures intended to reduce climate change."
    3. Sustainability projects gain financial backing. Throughout 2013, many studies and analyses concluded that healthcare sustainability investments are not only good for a hospital or health system's mission — they are also good for financial reasons .
    The Commonwealth Fund released a groundbreaking report in November 2012, which said the healthcare system could save $15 billion over the next decade with sustainability initiatives. This year, reports on LEED-certified hospitals, combined heat and power systems and other energy efficiency measures bubbled to the surface, each indicating there are hard savings from sustainability projects. Hospital finance leaders have started to take notice.
    "Speaking as a CFO, if done right, [sustainability efforts] could have good financial results for an organization," Steve Glass, CFO of Cleveland Clinic, told Becker's Hospital Review earlier this year. "There are many examples out there. We make sure we are mindful of the environment and utilizing resources that could reduce waste, our footprint and costs."
    4. New York mayor says hospitals play key role in fighting climate change. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg laid out a $20 billion plan in June to protect the city against the effects of climate change, and he said New York City's hospitals will play a key role. The plan came more than a half year after Hurricane Sandy decimated New York and other areas along the low-lying East Coast. Mayor Bloomberg said hospitals in the future will have higher design and construction standards to withstand bigger natural disasters.
    5. Hospital food environments becoming healthier. In May, Health Care Without Harm's Healthy Food in Health Care program found hospitals are ramping up their sustainable food purchasing and, overall, are promoting healthier food experiences. For example, more than 80 percent of respondents said they have initiated some kind of "healthy beverage" program, which included reducing or eliminating sugary drinks and soda. About 70 percent of hospitals said they are increasing use of tap water instead of bottled water as well.

    Energy Independence: Zero Net Energy: Building Expertise For Sustainability
    Bernie Kotlier, director of the Green Building Solutions for the Labor Management Cooperation Committee, recently sat down to speak with Sean Reynolds of Energy Independence Magazine about this emerging technology, its benefits and the expertise involved in development and construction.
    As with most new technologies, there’s a group of early adopters; a group of highly skilled people, designers, architects, environmental consultants and contractors who are gaining this skill.
    Riverside, CA (PRWEB) December 30, 2013
    A Zero Net Energy (ZNE) building consumes zero energy from traditional utility grids and produces zero carbon emissions annually. The concept is not new, however with increasing energy costs, and continuing environmental concerns, ZNE buildings are quickly becoming a reality.
    Bernie Kotlier, director of the Green Building Solutions for the Labor Management Cooperation Committee, recently sat down to speak with Sean Reynolds of Energy Independence Magazine about this emerging technology, its benefits and the expertise involved in their development and construction. Kotlier says ZNE buildings are his favorite buildings. “The Department of Energy has a formal definition. Basically, what it says is that over the course of twelve months, of a one year cycle, that (ZNE) building will not take any net energy from the grid.”  Kotlier says there are also zero net electricity buildings that, simply stated, use no electricity from the grid, but ZNE technology makes it possible for complete energy sustainability, including natural gas, heating oil or any other energy source from outside of its environment. At present, there are only a handful of new ZNE buildings under construction. According to Kotlier, California’s energy policy calls for all new residential buildings to be ZNE by 2020 and all new commercial construction to be ZNE by 2030.
    Kotlier says for the average builder, because of the level of sophistication involved in building these structures, it can be difficult, but adds, “As with most new technologies, there’s a group of early adopters; a group of highly skilled people, designers, architects, environmental consultants and contractors who are gaining this skill.” An example of this effort is a facility in San Leandro California that Kotlier knows a lot about. It is the joint training facility of the National Electrical Contactors Association (NECA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW.) The Zero Net Energy Center ( http://www.znecenter.org ) is the first commercial building retrofit designed to meet the U.S. Department of Energy’s requirements for a ZNE building. The 46,000 square-foot ZNE Center will serve as the educational facility for more than 2,000 apprentice and journey-level electricians in Alameda County. According to their website, “In addition to being the very first retrofit of an existing commercial building that meets the U.S. Department of Energy standards for a zero net energy building, the ZNE Center also exceeds the State of California’s 2030 energy efficiency effort by meeting the zero net goal 17 years in advance. It also exceeds the energy conservation goals of the Obama administration’s Better Buildings Challenge.”
    Kotlier says that while these buildings presently cost about 30 percent more to build, the cost is coming down and the energy savings in the long term will offset the initial construction costs. Because of programs like the San Leandro training facility, he says the level of skill it takes to install and maintain these systems is also rising. One resource that he recommends for finding the right technicians and contractors is the California Advanced Lighting Controls Training Program (CALCTP.) It is a non-profit partnership, which Kotlier co-founded and co-chairs, which trains and certifies licensed electrical contractors and state-certified general electricians in the proper installation, calibration, programming, commissioning and maintenance of advanced lighting control systems http://www.calctp.org . Another is the NECA website at http://www.necanet.org .  “Many of those contactors are highly skilled, although not all are trained in ZNE technology,” he says, “but they can contribute their high level of skill in areas like lighting, solar and HVAC to assist in building ZNE projects.”
    For many, ZNE makes good sense for the environment and for energy sustainability.  As far as good fiscal sense is concerned, Kotlier has a simple message.
    “Just imagine the billions and billions of dollars that people are now spending on electricity and gas… that can go into education and construction and creating jobs.  That’s a real exciting prospect for the economy.”

    Local sourcing of meat and seafood tops the list of predicted trends for 2014, according to U.S. chefs.
    Nearly 1,300 professional chefs were surveyed for the National Restaurant Association's annual forecast of trends for next year's menus.
    The categories of environmental sustainability, locally sourced and grown ingredients, and the reduction of food waste ranked in the first 11 of Top 20 trends for 2014. Locally grown produce ranked No. 2 on the list, followed by environmental sustainability at No. 3. Healthful kids' meals came in at No. 4 and gluten-free cuisine was No.5.
    Hyper-local sourcing through restaurant gardens ranked No. 6, children's nutrition was No. 7, non-wheat noodles came in at No. 8, sustainable seafood was No. 9, and the use of farm/estate-branded items was No. 10 on the list.
    The reduction of food waste through nose-to-tail/root-to-stalk cooking, which means using the entire animal or plant, was No. 11 on the list.
    Micro-distilled or artisan spirits are expected to be the most popular trend at the bar next year, the survey said, followed by locally produced wine, beer and spirits; drinks that are barrel-aged at the restaurant; cocktails made with savory ingredients, and signature drinks that have a regional connection.
    Laura Abshire, the NRA's director of sustainability and government policy, said the practice of sustainability makes fiscal and environmental sense.
    "Sustainably minded chefs and restaurateurs are realizing they can be more efficient, save on utility costs and also increase their bottom lines," Abshire said in a release announcing the findings. "Not only that, they can increase their customer engagement, especially among millennials, who often demand the businesses they frequent reflect their own values."
    Market research firm Mintel said the impressive growth of the fast casual restaurant segment is fueled by the increasing willingness of consumers to pay more for food they consider to be healthier or of better quality.
    Mintel said transparency in general business practices, including the treatment of employees, is also taken into consideration by diners.
    Full-service restaurants are starting to mimic some of the concepts of the fast casual service model, including speedier service, healthier menu items and the use of technology, Mintel said.
    The NRA said tablet menus are the top technology trend for 2014, followed by smartphone apps for customers, smartphone apps for chefs, mobile payment and social media marketing.
    Food items and cooking techniques that have gotten trendier since last year include nose-to-tail/root-to-stalk cooking, pickling, ramen, dark greens, and Southeast Asian cuisine.
    What's not so hot going into 2014? Greek yogurt, sweet potato fries, new cuts of meat, grass-fed beef, and organic coffee aren't nearly as trendy as they were last year, the NRA survey said.
    Chefs said trends that are on their way out include items made with foam, froth or air; bacon-flavored chocolate; fish offal and "fun-shaped" children's items. Forty-nine percent of chefs surveyed said bruschetta was "yesterday's news" and 58 percent said the same thing about gazpacho.
    The NPD Group said consumers didn't increase the number of visits they made to restaurants in 2013, but they did spend more money when they went out.
    The market research firm said consumer spending was up 2 percent from last year, driven by growth in average check size.
    Visits to quick service restaurants -- including gourmet coffee, donut and bagel restaurants -- were up 1 percent in the year ending September, compared to a year ago, while fast casual restaurants saw an 8 percent increase. Full service restaurants, casual dining restaurants, and mid-priced family restaurants, however, have not seen gains in several years, the NPD report said.
    NPD said 2014 should be a little better, with restaurant visits up 1 percent and a spending gain of 3 percent by the end of next year.
    "Although consumers are expected to be cautious about their spending in the coming years, our forecast for traffic and dollar growth for 2014 shows improved performance compared to 2013," Bonnie Riggs, NPD restaurant industry analyst, said in a release.
    "Despite overall industry demand holding steady, there will always be winners ... or those who can win the battle for market share."

  :title: 4 ways 2013 was the year of social sustainability - GreenBiz.com (blog)
  :text: |

    2013 was the year of social media sustainability. No longer does "stakeholder engagement" mean personally contacting a list of 500 "sustainarati" experts. Today you’re expected to throw open your doors to millions of consumers, staff and affected communities online — none of whom will quietly listen to your CSR story, but rather want to tell you their own.
    We used to speak of the "goldfish bowl" of transparency, where everyone can see everything. Now sustainability communications on social media is like a market bazaar where everyone — from individuals to multinationals — gets the same amount of space to set out and sell their wares.
    So here are a few honorable (and dishonorable) mentions for those catching my eye in the noise and bustle of 2013 and my predictions for what will stand out in the 2014 marketplace.
    1. Behavior change
    Behavior change and sustainable consumption was the hot-topic of 2013, so it’s unsurprising to find so many change campaigns popping up online:
    Uncle Ben’s — Ben’s Beginners Cooking Contest
    This Facebook driven campaign challenged parents to cook healthy meals with their children and post a video of how it went. More than 700 videos were submitted and some are hilarious, nearly 60,000 votes were cast and Uncle Ben’s Facebook "likes" increased by 84%. Well cooked.
    Toyota — Exit the Highway campaign
    Unexpected call from a car manufacturer to ‘get off the highway’ and take photos of your family frolicking in nature. Run through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram using the hasthtag #exitthehighway, 8,000 photos came in over 2 months and 48,000 people pledged to exit the highway.
    WWF — Earth Hour
    The granddaddy of behavior change, with (purportedly) billions of us taking part. In 2013 they went big on social with an integrated campaign across Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, Vimeo and Youtube (plus a few I probably didn’t notice). This year Earth Hour enjoyed a 50% uptick in tweets from previous years and a deluge of Instagram pics.
    Prediction for 2014: Social media campaigns to change consumer behaviors will take over sustainability in 2014. This is my No. 1 predicted trend. The most successful will link up social media, Big Data and digital technologies to really dig into behavioral psychology, rather than just making a reputational splash on Pinterest. Think Nest Labs and the Nike Fuel Band.

    SCOTLAND COUNTY, MO. -- A Heartland business is being recognized for its innovative practices that help make travel more sustainable.
    The Milkweed Mercantile was named one of the top "green" small businesses by Green America earlier in December.
    The mercantile is located in Dancing Rabbit Eco-Village, just north of Rutledge, Mo., and promotes a sustainable lifestyle centered on community. The Mercantile consists of a cafe and eco-inn, made entirely of sustainable materials. It was selected as a finalist for the award by a panel of experts in green living, then people from around the nation voted and named it the top green small business for travel.
    “It makes me really excited that people cared enough about our business to vote for us, because it's a pain in the butt, you have to go in there, you have to put your email in an you know you're going to get emails from this organization, but they did it anyway and that was incredibly meaningful, incredibly touching that, I mean the money is really nice, but  the money's almost beside the point, you know it just feels nice to have the community support,” said Alline Anderson. Anderson owns the mercantile with her husband Kurt Kessner.
    The Eco-inn is closed for the winter, but the cafe is open year round. They hold a pizza night every Thursday, and a Sunday brunch which all are welcome to attend. For more information about the Milkweed Mercantile and ways you can live more sustainably, watch KTVO news at 10 Thursday night.

  :title: 'Best of 2013: Mobile Sustainability - Kingstonist'
  :text: |
    Meg Lyons | December 30, 2013
    Our annual ‘best of’ series always tends to showcase our contributor’s latest gastronomic adventures , reinforcing Kingston’s enduring love affair with the local food scene.  2013 wasn’t any different, and as you may have noticed in our current review of the past year’s top trending stories, food trucks emerged as a decided focal point, attracting both mouth watering excitement and careful criticism.  Meg’s balanced exploration of the food truck scene considered the impact that these mobile purveyors of gourmet fare have had on traditional brick and mortar dining establishments, their sustainable advantages as well as their tireless promotion of locally produced ingredients.  While our gourmet local food trucks have all gone into hibernation for the season, one thing’s for certain, for better or worse, we can expect them (and more) to roll back into Kingston in 2014.
    ——————————
    Mobile Sustainability
    Trailer fare has steered into a fresh new direction with an undeniable facelift, transforming your average chip trucks into slick mobile eateries as top chefs trade restaurant kitchens for the tight squeeze of mobile cooking quarters. Gone are the deep-fried chips and corndogs, in are gourmet dishes that you would normally find in an upscale sit-down restaurant. Canadian cities continue to adopt the mobile truck trend as increasing mobile eateries dock curbside to serve specialty cuisine. Kingston’s on the list this spring as we welcome the movement into the downtown core and prepare for Kingston’s first gourmet food truck.
    It’s no secret Downtown Kingston prides itself on locally owned restaurants and for the most part, has continued to maintain its historic and elegant appearance, keeping the major franchise restaurants away from the heart of downtown or otherwise neatly blended into our limestone buildings so not to scream franchise food.
    Newcomers Milestones and Jack Astor’s caused a stir , arguably threatening Kingston’s now sustainable focused core as four local destinations; The Pasta Shelf, Aroma, Zappa’s and Tango almost simultaneously closed down. To blame those closures on these restaurants moving in is up for debate, however, it does show the risk associated with interlacing the downtown core with these major restaurant franchises.
    The question becomes, do food trucks pose the same risk?
    The controversial debate exists throughout North American cities as restaurants fight to keep a radius surrounding their front door clear of booming mobile eateries and lean on laws that prevent trucks from operating on public property. However in Kingston’s case, the mobile food movement does not appear to be a threat to the local bistro scene but instead a welcomed and anticipated addition to the Kingston nucleus. In fact, food trucks could be the next big thing in Kingston that will further promote local sustainability and add some positive zing to the growing metropolis without taking away from our lakeside sophistication.
    Food trucks are a great competitor in sustainable innovations and, arguably, increasingly more esthetically appealing as the movement continues to roar. With a reputation of traveling to different locations throughout the season, it’s true food trucks emit greenhouse gas emissions. However, compared to traditional restaurants, their carbon footprint remains pretty small. In fact, despite the need to run generators, the mere size of a food truck forces them to preserve water and electricity, keeping the eco-footprint relatively small as well. They have the potential to be eco-friendly Green machines.
    Call them what you want, but the trucks have the ability to support the local economy and in Kingston’s case, provide an outlet for local farmers and bring the community together alongside our sustainability objective.
    Kingstonians and Kingston entrepreneurs have responded positively and appear to support the mobile food scene about to spice up the downtown core. It shows on social media, in particular the response to Farm Girl Mobile Food Co. ,
    Kingston’s first gourmet food truck geared to serving homemade rustic cuisine using only the freshest local produce. With an ever budding list of over 500 followers, tweets from Kingstonians alike illustrate just how keen the city folks are to have the 18-foot self-sustained mobile food truck out on the streets for business.
    Inspired by local farmers and community, Farm Girl chef and owner Tamara Bolger intends to give back to the community by supporting the local farmers and supplying only local produce, using her own home-grown veggies alongside locally sourced food from local farmers and Wendy’s Mobile Market – which supplies local produce to several of our local restaurants pocketed throughout the downtown core.
    Farm Girl is a prime example of how the food truck cult has more to offer than just the convenience of meals on wheels. Of course, the potential to be eco-friendly relies heavily on the vendor, but sustainable practices make them a good addition to communities.
    It is true not all food trucks are geared toward freshly sourced produce and may not carry the biggest eco-footprint; however what remains fact is trucks don’t depend on elegantly lit seating to please their patrons. Cutting out dining areas saves a wad of electricity, not to mention a lot of green space.
    That being said, in a matter of weeks we will see how Kingstonians take to Farm Girl curbside. Locavores dedicated to eating locally tend to remain loyal to the community and continue to eat where sustainable initiatives have been set are willing to try new things.

  :title: Sustainability Goes Mainstream - U.S. News & World Report (blog)
  :text: |
    Tweet
    The face of sustainability is changing, according to a new  report by Boston Consulting Group and MIT Sloan Management Review . In a worldwide  survey of more than 1,000 executives and managers, BCG and Sloan took the pulse  of sustainability efforts. Their research shows that sustainability is steadily  growing in importance and is being integrated into the mainstream of corporate  strategy. Most importantly, the key drivers of sustainability are evolving.
    Customer preference leads  the way.
    In the early days of corporate sustainability work,  companies focused  on easy changes that cut operating costs while benefiting  the  environment. Energy-saving came first: replacing light bulbs, upgrading   HVAC and improving logistics. But that's changing, perhaps because the  low  hanging fruit has mostly been picked. Now, more companies are  discovering that their  customers have a preference for products that  are more clean, safe and  sustainable. Many customers will pay more for  sustainable products and services,  and they prefer to buy from  companies that provide them.
    [ See a collection of political cartoons on energy policy .]
    The power of customer preference comes through loud and  clear in the  survey results. Customer preference and customers' willingness to  pay a  premium was the single most important factor driving sustainability   efforts, as shown below:
    This is extremely encouraging, because a combination of marketplace   dynamics (customer preference, competitive pressure) alongside  regulatory  measures will likely be much more effective and economically  efficient than  regulation alone.
    [ See a collection of political cartoons on the economy .]
    Growing recognition  of sustainability as a competitive issue
    As the forces driving sustainability are becoming more   customer-centric, corporate leaders are recognizing that a  sustainability  strategy is essential for success. Of those polled, 62 percent said a  sustainability-oriented strategy is needed today. Nearly  40 percent agreed that  sustainability is "permanently on [the] top  management agenda and [is] a core  strategic consideration" for their  companies.
    Growing recognition  that pursuit of sustainability can boost profit
    For most companies, sustainability-related actions add more to   profits more than they detract. Roughly three times as many business  leaders  said that sustainability initiatives added to profit (32  percent) than took away from  profit (11 percent). This suggests that in  general, businesses are picking  sustainability initiatives wisely, and  implementing them successfully.
    [ Read the U.S. News Debate: Should the Government Invest in Green Energy? ]
    Widespread  Acknowledgement of Climate Change as a Threat
    Despite ongoing efforts by some industry lobbyists to  belittle  climate change, an overwhelming majority of those polled believe that   climate change is both real and caused by human activity – and that  their companies  are largely unprepared for the threat. A full 88  percent of those polled agreed that "climate change is real." Nearly as  many (79 percent) agree that "climate change is a  risk to political  and social stability." But only 34 percent believe their company is   properly prepared for climate change. At this point, the climate threat  is  still too far off for most companies to respond. Energy efficiency  remains the  top environmental priority among the companies polled.  Rising energy costs,  rather than climate-related damage, are driving  corporate decision-making in  this area.
    The Sloan-BCG report brings welcome news. It's great to  see the  steady rise in support for sustainability initiatives, the   mainstreaming of sustainability with the rest of corporate strategy and  a  growing recognition that sustainability boosts profits of the  traditional kind.  But the best news is that customer preferences and  competitive pressure are now  driving sustainability forward. Gone are  the days when sustainability efforts  relied solely on regulation and on  the enlightened owners of privately-held  firms. With market forces now  propelling companies forward, we can expect more  and faster progress  in years ahead.

    Coveney must act to retain the sustainability of family farms – ICSA
    By Richard Halleron on December 31, 2013
    ICSA Ireland, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, president elect Patrick Kent has told AgriLand that Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney must act decisively to ensure the ongoing sustainability of family farms in Ireland.
    “No doubt the minister is fully aware that 2014 has been designated the ‘International Year of Family Farming’. And nowhere in Europe does this term have more resonance than here in Ireland,” he added.
    “And the first thing that he could do in this regard is ensure that the next Rural Development Programme is adequately funded. The reality is that schemes such as REPS have been tremendously influential in improving the vitality of our rural areas. And it goes without saying that all of this work must be built on during the period ahead. But this will require an adequate level of funding. ”
    Continuing on the theme of sustainability, Kent stressed that Irish consumers must be made more aware of the tremendous quality, which is such a hallmark of locally produced food.
    “There is far too much junk food being sold in our shops,” he further explained.
    “All of this can be quite easily replaced by home grown produce. Irish beef and lamb, produced from grazed grass, are truly elite products which must be recognised as such beyond the farm gate.
    “Part of the problem up to now is that home grown food has not been promoted effectively. And this must be changed.”
    The ICSA representative also pointed out that local consumers should be prepared to pay more for locally produced food.
    “Ten years ago 27 per cent of an average household income was dedicated to weekly food purchases,” he stressed.
    “Today the equivalent figure is just 17 per cent. During this same period, however, the quality of locally produced beef and lamb has improved significantly.”
    Kent is firmly of the view that Irish family farm businesses should not get caught up in a rat race, vying with each other to see who can produce the largest level of output.
    “Quality is the name of the game,” he continued.
    “Local farmers can invest in improved management systems which will allow them significantly improve the value of the produce they are bringing to market. And to achieve this, they must think beyond the meat plant and think pro-actively about the needs of consumers.
    “But the bottom line in all of this is that farmers must be paid accordingly. The days of cheap food are over.”

    Food, apparel vendors go sustainable
    Strategic Sourceror on
    Tuesday, December 31, 2013
    Often, companies that manufacture consumer goods find themselves under a particularly unforgiving spotlight. Industry insiders can be tough in their criticisms of firms' sourcing and procurement practices, but consumers themselves are considerably more demanding in their expectations when it comes to sustainability. 
    With eco-friendliness, fair trade and other concerns increasingly becoming subjects of public attention - and many individuals displaying very strong feelings about these issues - the consumer products market has little choice but to amend its practices in light of the developments. Two of the most critical segments of the market - clothing and food - have already made considerable headway in this regard.
    H&M holds suppliers accountable
    Producers of basic, essential goods are easy media targets for failures in sustainable product sourcing, and clothing manufacturers are no exception. Yet despite the problems in supplier transparency and ethics that often accompany offshore manufacturing - a widespread procurement practice in the industry - some companies in this space are making clear that they are serious and committed to their efforts 
    Quartz contributor Sarah Labowitz, co-director of New York University's Center for Business and Human Rights, recently profiled the efforts toward sustainable supplier management made by major apparel manufacturer and retailer H&M. In December, the firm announced a plan to ensure that 850,000 employees who work for its strategic sourcing partners, primarily in Asia, would be paid a "fair living wage." H&M is set to begin putting the plan into action with its suppliers in Bangladesh and Cambodia in 2014, and if the model proves successful, it will soon be expanded to 750 more factories. 
    "It's an ambitious plan that expands the company's longstanding efforts on workplace issues in its supply chain," Labowitz wrote. She suggested that consumers could feel confident that "this is at least a serious effort" on the part of H&M to hold its supply chain accountable for its business practices.
    Food trucks: the sustainable restaurant?
    The restaurant industry is another subject of consumer attention regarding sustainability. But the food sector is also a hotbed of trends, and one of the most popular development in recent years has been the burgeoning food truck scene in a number of American cities.
    The Kingstonist recently raised the question of sustainability in reference to these "slick mobile eateries," pointing out that their size requires them to be particularly careful about water consumption and energy efficiency.
    "They have the potential to be eco-friendly green machines," the source wrote.
    Hopefully, 2014 will see increased demand and success for innovative strategies in sustainability among firms in this space.

    Capitol Hill’s Bullitt Center recognized as ‘the most sustainable building in the world’
    Posted on

    (Image: Bullitt Center)
    One of the most important Capitol Hill stories of 2013 was the Earth Day opening of The Bullitt Center at 15th and Madison — the greenest commercial office building in the world. The Center’s designers – The Miller Hull Partnership — are celebrating an important recognition to finish the year.
    Here’s an email from The Bullitt Foundation’s Denis Hayes about the $18.5 million center’s latest accolades:
    In a December 18th email, I alerted many of you that World Architecture News had selected the Bullitt Center as one of six finalists — and the only finalist from the United States — in its annual contest for the most sustainable building in the world. To be included in that elite group was, by itself, a singular honor.
    Tonight I am delighted to announce that the judging has been completed and the Bullitt Center has been selected as #1 in the world!
    Hearty congratulations to Miller Hull, to whom this architectural award really belongs, and to everyone on the Bullitt Center Team for bringing the MH vision to reality.
    Denis
    You can read more about the selection here :
    Built in Seattle, United States and initiated by Earth Day co-founder Denis Hayes with sustainability at the forefront of the design process from the off. The result is a design that has tackled the Living Building Challenge and come out the other side with a Net Zero Building Certification; the scheme is a shining example of sustainable building for the future. Ann Marie Aguilar of Arup Associates commented that: “This building really sets the debate about how to design buildings to be truly sustainable and make the lowest possible impact.” And we couldn’t agree more.
    The Bullit Center is the first leasable market rate commercial structure that meets the targets of the Living Building Challenge to the Net Zero Energy standard, including adhering to the omission of all toxic chemicals that appear on the prohibited ‘red list’ and also ensuring ‘One hundred percent of the project’s energy needs must be supplied by on-site renewable energy on a net annual basis’. Our panel really thought it shone through as an inspiration to future projects aiming for this level of sustainability, and as Mikael put it, ‘this building really tells a story’.
    Having met the entire annually targeted energy production in just seven months, the project was a clear success. The overhanging photovoltaic rooftop as well as the facade provide the energy for the entire building, supplying 230,000 kwh/year. The end result being that the overall energy usage is around 20% of that of the other buildings of its type in Seattle.
    Meanwhile, as it approaches its first anniversary, the building’s backers are searching for a tenant to fill 8,000 square feet on the center’s third floor:
    Creative, Collaborative Space in the Urban Pike/Pine Corridor! Adjacent to Downtown, South Lake Union and Madison Park. Recruit-ability and Retention – Absolutely!
    8,000 Sqft in total, can divide to 3,000 Sqft with shared resources on the floor.
    $30.00/SF + NNNs
    New Construction – Completely open floor plan ready to space plan for your company’s needs!
    The 3rd Floor offers an exclusive southern facing 750 Sqft terrace, 13′-0″ ceiling heights through out the floor constructed from FSC certified heavy timbers, steel supports and concrete floors. Controlled entry into the Building and onto your floor, dedicated interior bicycle parking garage and showers on your floor. Adjacent to the rejuvenated McGilvra Place Park. Great mix of tenants, from groups that work in the field of sustainability or organizations that have a desire to reduce their environmental impact.

  :title: Omran launches sustainability report - Muscat Daily

    H E Mohammed Jawad bin Hassan bin Sulaiman (left) launches the report
    December 29, 2013
    Muscat - 
    Under the auspices of H E Mohammed Jawad bin Hassan bin Sulaiman, advisor at the Ministry of Finance, Omran, the country’s leading tourism development, investment and hospitality asset management company, launched its ‘Baseline Sustainability Report: Creating a Sustainable Tourism Destination’ during a ceremony held at the company’s head office in Al Khuwayr.
    The launch was held in the presence of Omran’s senior management, including chief executive Eng Wael al Lawati, joint-venture partners as well as representatives from several government institutions.
    Compiled by Sustainability Excellence, a consultancy that annually assesses leading companies in the industry, the report has been produced in line with the internationally recognised sustainability principles and guidelines set by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and achieved a ‘Level B’ rating in terms of transparency and performance disclosure, a press release said.
    The current GRI rankings have placed Omran alongside the best Omani organisations and positioned it as the region’s most transparent developer. The Baseline Sustainability Report highlights the company’s performance between 2009 and 2012 using 86 environmental, economic and social indicators that aim to further promote transparency and enhance stakeholder accountability.
    The GRI is a network-based organisation that has pioneered the development of the world’s most widely used sustainability reporting frameworks and is committed to its continuous improvement and application worldwide.
    H E Nasser al Jashmi, chairman of Omran, said, “Our goal is to contribute to the diversification of the economy through tourism that protects the environment, promotes our cultural heritage and traditions, provides prosperity for our people and makes a positive impact on our local communities. This strategic direction is guided by a framework for responsible tourism development that makes sustainability its overriding priority.”

    In their quest to pursue growth and profits, many companies focus on reputation management alone while ignoring sustainable practices, which, according to a new report, is one of the most vital aspects of surviving in a crowded marketplace and should find its place among the core competitive strategies of a company.
    The most significant sustainability issues revolve primarily around three areas -- social, environmental and economic -- that cover issues ranging from climate change to health care programs for employees. And, according to a new global research report by MIT Sloan Management Review and The Boston Consulting Group, while many companies “walk the talk” in addressing major sustainability concerns, there is a chasm separating thought and actual action.
    “Walkers focus heavily on five business fronts: sustainability strategy, business case, measurement, business model innovation and leadership commitment,” the report said . “'Talkers,’ on the other hand, are equally concerned about the most significant sustainability issues, but address those issues to a far lesser degree.”
    Profits Over Longevity
    A suitable definition for business sustainability is that it represents resiliency over time and helps businesses survive shocks because they are closely connected to healthy economic, social and environmental systems. However, the new report, based on data from the past five years, says that many organizations continue to struggle with embracing sustainability issues, and choosing longevity over maximizing profits.
    According to the research, the percentage of companies that have successfully established sustainable business practices has only grown from 30 percent to 37 percent over the past five years. In comparison, the percentage of companies that have tried but failed to build a workable sustainable business model has increased from 8 percent to 20 percent in the same period.
    Worse, more than 50 percent of the report's respondents had not even tried to develop such a model.
    Problems Of Perception
    Asked how significant social, environmental and economic sustainability issues are to their organizations, nearly 80 percent of the respondents rated economic issues as significant or very significant. While 70 percent of them rated environmental issues similarly, 66 percent gave the same rating to social issues.
    The research also identified some important social and environmental concerns, which deserve attention from companies, but are not receiving enough of it. For example, only 13 percent of respondents from the IT and telecommunications sector considered pollution as one of their top three significant sustainability issues, compared with 18 percent across all industries.
    For industrial development to be sustainable, it must address important issues at the global level, which includes climate change -- one of the most pressing long-term issues -- but, according to the research, is not receiving what is arguably its due.
    Earlier this year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned against the dire effects of human influence on global warming. However, despite the scientific attention the issue has garnered, climate change continued to be low on respondents’ lists of significant sustainability issues, the study found.
    According to the report, while two-thirds of the respondents agreed that climate change is real, only 11 percent ranked it as a very significant environmental issue. The study also exposed the lack of preparedness, with only 9 percent of respondents being in strong agreement that their companies were prepared to deal with climate change risks.
    The report recommended taking a cue from companies in reinsurance and banking, which depend on mitigating financial risk and were found to be seriously considering longer-term issues such as climate change.
    In addition to climate change, the research also raised concerns about the fact that other crucial sustainability issues, which are less tangible or less industry-specific, barely registered on the corporate radar. For example, issues such as human rights, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion and desertification were found at the bottom of the list of social sustainability concerns.
    Walkers Over Talkers
    The report said that “Walkers” are the companies that are closing the gap between thought and action by creating comprehensive, dedicated sustainability efforts. More than 90 percent of the Walkers had developed a strategy, compared to only 46 percent of Talkers.
    Walkers also beat Talkers in terms of making sustainability a top management agenda item as 70 percent of the former had it as a permanent item on their company’s senior management to-do list, compared to only 24 percent of the latter.
    According to a report from Bloomberg , a sustainable business model pays off and a perfect example of this can be seen in corporate America, where sustainability is steadily becoming part of the mainstream, helping companies produce “cost savings, revenue growth, and competitive advantage, along with environmental benefits.”
    “Some companies succeed by targeting sophisticated consumers who prefer to pay more for a product that is organic, healthier, produced in [a] cleaner or safer way,” David Brodwin, co-founder of the  American Sustainable Business Council , said earlier this year . “Still other companies succeed because the pursuit of sustainability leads to a higher quality product, with fewer defects and rejects.”

  :title: Sustainable at the supermarket? - Chico News & Review

    Beware of natural-foods brands that are contributing funds to defeat Prop. 37—the Right to Know Initiative—which will call for foods containing GMOs to be labeled as such. CN&R, 08.30.12.

    In an ideal world, every person would eat the most healthful and nutritious meals possible. They’d have organic, local ingredients—sustainably Sourced, from farmers’ markets and natural-food stores, or from their own gardens—carefully prepared in delicious dishes.
    We don’t live in an ideal world, of course. In the real world, time crunches and financial pinches affect personal choices. Many Chicoans shop at S&S Organic Produce & Natural Foods, the Chico Natural Foods Cooperative and the Saturday-morning downtown farmers’ market, but many also rely on supermarkets like Safeway or Raley’s for their sustenance.
    Is it possible to be sustainable at the supermarket, or are “green” and “grocery store” mutually exclusive?
    It’s possible, says Marsha Vernoga, a registered dietician and nutrition-education specialist at Chico State University. However, she concedes, “it is a bit challenging.”
    Supermarkets carry thousands of items—many of them processed foods manufactured by national and multinational companies. Even brands that sound local or organic, such as Celestial Seasonings teas and Silk almond/soy/coconut milks, often fall under corporate umbrellas (see accompanying chart for some examples).
    “‘Big Food’ is really buying into the organic trend because there’s such an increased demand for organic food,” Vernoga said. “You go to the dairy aisle and see Horizon Organic Milk; it’s produced by the same company that right next to it has regular [nonorganic] milk.
    “They still have to abide by organic standards, but as bigger companies start owning these smaller organic or health-food businesses, oftentimes those practices get diluted.”
    Even finding the right raw ingredients—sustainable meats and seafood, and non-GM (genetically modified) produce—can be a challenge. You’re typically safe when you see a seal denoting organic certification, Vernoga said; nonetheless, you may need to double-check with the butcher or produce manager to make certain you’re getting what you expect.
    “GMOs [genetically modified organisms] are tricky because, really, they’re in everything,” Vernoga said. “[GMO] corn and soy—those are the two foods that are in almost all processed foods, so it’s very hard to get around them. Plus, unless you get organic meat, you are going to get GMO food indirectly from the animal, because that’s what they’re eating.”
    Along with corn and soy, other common GMO foods include papaya, summer squash, sugar and canola.
    One common conception of healthful eating relates to expense—namely, that good food costs more. A recent assessment from the Harvard School of Public Health found that the average American would need to spend just $1.50 more per day for a more nutritious diet. Researchers came to that conclusion after crunching numbers from 27 studies, evaluating prices of more healthful options for common foods (e.g., lean versus fatty beef) as well as broad habits (e.g., Mediterranean diet versus meat-heavy diet).
    This dovetails with Vernoga’s local experience. Organics may cost more, she said; still, depending on what you buy and where you buy it, you can find good deals. She’s particularly fond of farmers’ markets, and even at local health-food stores, “if you buy the right things, often it’s not that expensive.”
    By “right things” she means produce, bulk beans, brown rice, oats and other wholesome ingredients, which are available in supermarkets, too.
    Processed foods may be more problematic than whole foods (and can actually be more costly than cooking with whole foods), but green-minded consumers don’t have to forgo convenience entirely. Local producers include Lundberg Family Farms (rice products), Maisie Jane’s (nut confections) and Mary’s Gone Crackers (baked goods). Other brands recommended by Vernoga include: Amy’s Kitchen, Blue Diamond, Bob’s Red Mill, Cal-Organic Farms, Clif Bar, Eden Foods and Vitasoy.
    Overall, though, she encourages people to take a more hands-on approach to food.
    “No matter where you shop, even if you’re shopping mainstream, I think the key is cooking more,” Vernoga said, “because you have more control over the ingredients you’re using.”
    Ah, cooking: another concept full of preconceptions. Busy people often shy away from preparing their own meals because of the time and effort they think it takes. Rosemary Febbo, a local cookbook author who hosted a long-running radio show on local FM community radio station KZFR, says the kitchen needn’t intimidate.
    “If you approach cooking with the attitude of just getting something on the plate to eat, this can be accomplished in very little time,” she wrote in an email from New York, while on a layover following an extended vacation in Italy. “I’ve developed meals that take maybe 10 minutes to cook, serve and eat when I’m really hungry and in a hurry—and that are all from scratch, healthful and satisfying.
    “Quesadillas come to mind: Corn tortillas, good cheese, fresh salsa, maybe some shredded lettuce or cabbage and stuffed with some leftover chicken or meat can make a complete meal in just the time it takes for the cheese to melt. … I think every ethnic cuisine has a traditional healthful dish that can be prepared in no time at all.”
    That said, Febbo recommends taking culinary experiments to the next level.
    “Taking time to cook a healthful meal is not only therapeutic but the results are [also] far superior to any processed foods,” she wrote. “Healthful meals take time to prepare. Not only do you need to shop for the ingredients, but you [also] do need to develop some techniques that keep the nutrients of the food at the highest levels. Blanching, steaming, roasting, grilling are all cooking techniques that lend themselves to healthier eating.”
    Febbo has posted a wide range of recipes on her website ( www.roseskitchen.com ).
    “For what you spend on processed foods,” she said, “oftentimes you can make two or three meals out of fresh foods.” Plus: “The process of cooking for me is part of the joy of eating.”

  :title: 5 Reasons to be optimistic about 2014 - Triple Pundit
  :text: |
    Tweet
    This is the time of the year when you see endless summaries of 2013. The ones about sustainability  can usually be characterized as  a bag of mixed news, filled with both good and bad news from the past year.
    And it can be quite depressing, right? After all, mixed news means that at best we move forward in tiny steps when it comes to sustainability, while we need to be running as fast as we can.
    Nevertheless, I think there’s no room for depression. First, it doesn’t really help get you anywhere. Second, looking carefully at the trends that shaped 2013 you see that there are also some good reasons to be optimistic, even if you’re into systematic changes, not just incremental ones. And no, this is not about choice editing and ignoring the bad news, but about identifying which sustainability trends become dominant and which ones are about to vanish.
    So looking back at 2013 here are five trends that should keep you optimistic about sustainability in 2014:
    1. Local is the new black – One of the findings in IBM’s  annual “5 in 5″ predictions report , which predicts how innovations that will change our lives in the next five years, is that buying local will beat online . “…Over the next five years, local stores and shops will flip the javascript by giving us an immersive, mixed real and virtual experience. And being local will become increasingly important as shoppers demand the instant gratification of their purchases.”
    We can already see the first signs of this convergence of user-friendly technology platforms with local business activity in services like Good Eggs , an online version of your local farmers market, or Farmigo , which enhances the capabilities of a traditional CSA. The trend is also an important element driving local-based sharing economy services like Yerdle , RelayRides or ParkAtMyHouse .
    Yet, local is the new black not just because local shopping and sharing are becoming more sophisticated and convenient, but also because this is the level where we see most progressive action taking place to address important challenges, from local communities in Colorado voting to ban fracking to cities significantly raising their minimum wage to New York City council voting last week to require composting at large restaurants in the city . So, go local!
    2.  More sunlight – “Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants,” Justice Louis Brandies famously wrote in 1914.
    In 2013 we had plenty of sunlight. Companies and organizations  learned time and again that we’re at the age where almost nothing can stay in the dark. I guess you don’t have to be a futurist to realize this trend will only get stronger – the power of the Internet, mobile technology and social media will make it increasingly impossible to hide skeletons in the closet.
    In 2014 I expect companies to continue learning the lesson that they’re no more in charge of their level of transparency. The effort they put into thinking about what to include and what not to include in their sustainability report is quite meaningless. If businesses have issues such as poor working conditions in their supply chain, toxic waste dumping or corporate tax avoidance, they need to deal with them sooner than later. Hiding them is no longer an option.
    3. Upping the game – The sustainable business world is getting more sophisticated. In 2013 you could see it on every piece of the sustainability puzzle, including innovation , design , systems thinking , changing consumer behavior , natural resources valuation , employee engagement , sustainability reporting , and  materiality to name a few.
    Overall, this is good news because to win, sustainability professionals have to be at the top of the game. We might not be there yet but if you look at the issues mentioned above and compare where we stand now to where we were even just three or five years ago you will be pleasantly surprised at the progress made in such a short time. I’m hopeful to see more of it next year.
    4. Human power – While we tend to think of people in terms of ‘problem’ (population growth, overconsumption) and focus on events like Black Friday to justify this connection, there’s a growing school of thought looking at people as the ‘solution’ as well.
    Why is it important? Because the way we frame people will eventually determine the way we act, and arming ourselves with a positive approach is a powerful way to drive positive change, as renowned international design thinker Ezio Manzini explains in the context of social innovation:
    “…Social resource is probably the most abundant one. So again, looking at it in a positive way, if we say we’re 7 billion, 9 billion, 10 billion, we can say this is the problem – we have too many. OK, it’s a problem. But at the same time the people…are intelligent. The people could be creative, so we have to look in a different way. We have 7 billion people and tomorrow 9 billion of intelligent entities that should be challenged. And of course the system could make the people take the stupid part, the lazy part of the people, or can try to empower the positive side of these billions of people. So the challenge of social innovation and design for social innovation is exactly this one – to help catalyze the potential in terms of creativity of all this quantity of people and to create a sustainable world.”
    5. Understanding how we’re wired – Even with all the empathy in the world for human beings, we need a better understanding of how we’re wired in order to get us in the right direction. Luckily, we’re beginning to make some progress here with the help of behavioral economics with more companies and governments listening carefully to advice from behavioral economists like Dan Ariely and Richard Thaler about the flaws of human nature and how to overcome these obstacles with relatively simple yet powerful tools like smart choice architecture or reward substitution .
    The premise of these tactics is that we can get people to behave in the right way even if not always from the right reasons. Hopefully we’ll see more of this in 2014. Happy New Year!

    Sustainability Becoming a Mainstream Corporate Strategy: BCG-Sloan Report
    Blog Entry by Vikas Vij in Corporate Social Responsibility
    December 27, 2013 - 11:03pm
    Friday, December 27, 2013 - 11:00pm
    (3BL Media/Justmeans) – The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and MIT Sloan Management Review have brought out a new report that shows the changing face of corporate strategy worldwide. In a global survey of more than a thousand business executives, BCG and Sloan found that businesses are increasingly integrating sustainability into their mainstream corporate strategy.
    Companies are discovering that a large number of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable goods and services, and prefer to buy from businesses that provide them. In the survey results, customer preference and customers’ willingness to pay a premium came up as the single most important factor that is driving companies across the world to step up their sustainability efforts and commitment.
    62 percent of the respondents in the survey said that a sustainability-oriented corporate strategy is the need of the hour. Two in five respondents agreed that sustainability is “permanently” on the top of their management agenda and is a core strategic consideration for their companies. About three times (32 percent) as many business leaders pointed out thatsustainability effort added to their profitability than took away from profits (11 percent).
    The report quotes the examples of several leading companies that are committing themselves to making sustainability a part of their mainstream corporate strategy. Domtar, a $6 billion Canadian-based global enterprise, is a paper products company that aims to turn its natural sustainability threat into a viable long-term business strategy through green innovation. Another example is Avis Budget Group’s 2013 acquisition of Zipcar, which addresses the concerns of excessive pollution arising out of an increasing number of cars. Zipcar’s goal is to promote the usage of shared cars to reduce congestion, pollution and parking challenges.
    In the industrial sector, GE is helping airlines reduce fuel costs as well as cut down carbon emissions with its innovative engine technologies. Hilton Worldwide is another case in point quoted in the BCG-Sloan report about how the company is employing sustainability strategies to make an environmental impact and create business value. Dell is working closely with its entire supply chain to cut electronic waste and produce more sustainable laptops.
    The report points out another example, Kaiser Permanente, which has codified its sustainability priorities and identified key areas that could have the maximum impact on public health. GM and Honda have also joined forces to develop hydrogen fuel cells to be used in each company’s cars.

    Sustainability is an important part of any industrial function. A big driver of growth and continuing success, it is what many experts believe the defining factor of excellence and achievement in the industrial and manufacturing sector in the 21st Century. Hence, organizations are committed to excellence in this field. In India too, companies are seeking to increase sustainability.
    One among them is Mukesh Ambani owned Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). The Nagothane Manufacturing Division (NMD) of RIL has bagged the prestigious Golden Peacock Award for Sustainability 2013. The selection rounds and the award ceremony were held at London from October 1- 4, 2013.  The Golden Peacock Award for Sustainability has been instituted to encourage sustainable development. It recognizes the urgency and magnitude of the risks and threats to collective sustainability, alongside increasing choices and opportunities, and mandates transparency in economic, environmental and social impact corporate initiatives lead to. The Golden Peacock Global Award for Sustainability aims to stimulate organizations to rapidly accelerate the pace of stakeholder oriented improvement process.
    Golden Peacock Awards, instituted by Institute of Directors in 1991, are now regarded as Holy Grail of Corporate Excellence Worldwide. Today Golden Peacock Awards Secretariat receives over 1,000 entries per year for various awards, from over 25 countries worldwide. The achievement of the Golden Peacock Award is the most powerful way to build your brand. The Award winners are eligible to use the Golden Peacock Awards logo on all printed and promotional materials for next one year, which evidences to all its customers and suppliers the highest accolade acclaimed by the company. No business award today receives the kind of recognition and adulation among peers that the Golden Peacock does. They provide not only worldwide recognition and prestige, but a competitive advantage in driving business in this tumultuous world
    This isn’t the first time RIL has been presented with this prestigious award. RIL’s Hazira Manufacturing Division (Which was also presented three Platinum awards at the 2nd Lean Six Sigma Convention of the CBE and the highest honour of the International Convention on Quality Control Circles 2013) was awarded with the Golden Peacock award for sustainability in 2008. RIL has also been presented the award in 2009 and 2011.

    Europe’s sustainability strategy
    With poverty rising increasingly on the national agenda of various EU member states, various think tanks, institutions and even governments have been asking themselves a question that was recently posed – will Europe’s sustainability strategy end up as a casualty of the euro crisis or will it pave the way for an ambitious restart?
    As things stand, Europe’s economy should not just grow but it should also target social inclusion and the responsible use of resources. This point was made forcefully by the Bertelsmann Stiftung (a private non-profit foundation in Germany) only days ago.
    Their main concern was that although the goal of sustainability may be embedded in the European Union treaty and the EU’s economic strategies, the emphasis on GDP growth and competitiveness in battling the crisis is, according to them, threatening to undermine efforts to establish a common approach for sustainable economic activity.
    There is no doubt that a sustainable Europe needs a strategy that facilitates economic strength and political stability, while guaranteeing the viability of social and environmental systems.
    That it is indeed time for a new approach is triggered even more by the fact that progress, so far, has been erratic and sporadic in spite of the EU having developed its own sustainability strategy (EU SDS) way back in 2001.
    Most of this strategy’s key features were a decade later, integrated into the EU’s 10-year growth strategy, Europe 2020.
    The general feeling is that they have lost traction in practice as time went by. The EU SDS had been created in tandem with the Lisbon strategy that had originally been in place until 2010.
    Not only was the objective of a 70 per cent employment rate not met but even though more people were employed, this had failed to reduce the poverty.
    While the Lisbon strategy drew a distinction between economic, financial, employment and social concerns, Europe 2020 by contrast had been designed to achieve what advocates of sustainable development have long called for – making social and environmental issues axiomatic components of economic thinking.
    There seems to be a strong feeling that sustainability has been tossed by the wayside as member states targeted more or less exclusively GDP growth, enhanced competitiveness and budget reforms.
    With the commission nearing its cyclical life-end, the general opinion is that it will not be undertaking any further revision of the old EU SDS.
    On the other hand, there are many who understandably argue that Europe 2020 and the EU SDS should be prioritised and negotiated as a package by the incoming European Commission.
    Only this way can Europe tangibly make a timely contribution to the post-2015 agenda. Unless the EU SDS will be synchronised with that of the UN agenda for the post-2015 era, rhetoric is likely to prevail.
    We can only play a prominent part in shaping UN development goals for this new era if our own goals become more ambitious in this GDP-oriented, crisis management-oriented phase.
    If we really mean business, we must look at innovative solutions, new business models, adopt a green mindset and also think in terms of rewarding green investments.
    We need to rethink our future
    Under the Danish presidency of the EU, there was a strong push to ensure that improving resource efficiencies in the value chain would lead to tangible results. One telling lesson we can ill afford to ignore is that not only do climate and environmental challenges impact in particular fragile states with low resilience and capacity to deal with lack of water, food or extreme weather conditions. But perhaps even more importantly, that this inter linkage between green solutions and conflict prevention should not be ignored.
    I remain impressed by an observation made in the Danish capital when I had attended a conference there in my capacity as shadow minister. That with focus, resolve and ambition, we can lower the global thermostat and raise the level of economic opportunity for all – from the poorest households to the largest enterprises.
    During a global green growth forum, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon posed some interesting challenges to one and all. Mainly we all need to raise our level of ambition by scaling up the investments and financial flows necessary for making the transformation to a low-carbon economy.
    When convening at next September’s climate summit, the UN secretary general was not simply thinking of a government leaders’ summit. He intends to bring together government, business, finance and civil society leaders from around the world to mobilise political will for the climate negotiations while delivering new commitments.
    all this is not the exclusive domain of the environmental sector, as many tend to conclude wrongly. Such enlightened action can create new jobs, improve public health, protect the environment and also spur sustainable green growth. In my opinion, the only key to success lies in engaging the private sector as proactively as possible.
    Governments need to engage in an intensive dialogue with the private sector to develop a deeper understanding of how public cooperation can best advance green growth.
    This can best be done through five key areas, for which its collaboration is pivotal: spurring innovation, creating green markets, improving natural resources management, enhancing resource efficiency and productivity while supporting green and climate resilient infrastructure.
    We need to rethink our future.

    As of 2011, 82% of U.S. energy comes from natural gas, petroleum and coal, according to a 2013 U.S. Energy System Factsheet from the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan.
    This is the sustainability issue University of Minnesota Ph.D. candidates worked to solve when they entered their idea for a renewable fuel-enabled free piston engine into The Dow Chemical Company's Sustainability Innovation Student Challenge Award (SISCA) competition .
    "Our project aims to provide a clean, efficient and sustainable power source for various sectors of the society," Chen Zhang and Ke Li wrote in an e-mail. "If our project succeeds, all the conventional internal combustion engines, which is the major consumer of petroleum, can be replaced by the free piston engine that can operate at higher efficiency and use a variety of renewable fuels."
    Zhang and Li are the two University of Minnesota grand prize winners of the 2013 SISCA competition. They received $10,000 to continue gathering data and begin commercializing their product.
    The SISCA program was established five years ago to promote innovative thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing the world's biggest sustainability challenges, according to Eunice Heath, global director for sustainability, business engagement and education at Dow.
    These include renewable energy, protecting the planet, public health and clean drinking water for everyone.
    "There's no one company or no one institution that has the answers to the problems, so we need to make sure that we are continuing to support the next generation that is going to drive policy, business decisions and innovation," Heath says.
    Graduate students from the 17 participating universities around the world submit project proposals that are judged on criteria including innovative thinking, excellence in research and the interdisciplinary nature of the work.
    At each university, a $10,000 grand prize and $2,500 runner up prizes are awarded.
    Zhang and Li say their free piston engine plan contains a control mechanism that lets engineers control the piston trajectory in real time, which improves engine efficiency and reduces emissions. This design allows the engine to run on various power sources, including renewable fuels.
    "[It] could be used as the power source for fieldwork devices and handheld or non-handheld equipment," Zhang and Li wrote. "It can be the power propulsion system for passenger vehicles and heavy machineries, and it can be used for distributed power generation."
    Michael Goldberg and Abigail Hawley, graduate students at Northwestern University, won Northwestern's SISCA prize.
    The pair, along with two other students, developed an anaerobic biodigester to convert organic waste from a local brewery into methane gas to be used for energy. Their project seeks to reduce carbon emissions and landfill waste.
    "The anaerobic biodigester prototype that we built could effectively generate usable energy while reducing waste," Goldberg and Hawley wrote in an e-mail. "This adds value to a waste product, which gives businesses an economic incentive to make their processes more sustainable."
    Goldberg and Hawley entered the SISCA competition to gain experience in the environmental field by creating sustainable energy solutions and using technology to reduce landfill waste.
    Students in other fields can also contribute to making the world more sustainable during their everyday activities.
    "Conscious minimization of one's environmental impact is critical," Goldberg and Hawley wrote. "[This includes] focused efforts to minimize environmental impact, such as refusal to buy plastic water bottles or use plastic bags at the store."
    In January 2014, the University of Queensland will join the SISCA program, becoming its 18th university.
    Heath says the SISCA program helps provide the next generation of leaders in the sciences with an interdisciplinary foundation for solving sustainability issues.
    Zhang and Li think this is critical because society's future development is built upon breakthroughs in technology.
    "Unfortunately, our current way of living depends heavily on energy consumption, and it doesn't scale well as the world population grows," Zhang and Li wrote. "Technical innovations have been and will be the driving force to overcome issues such as sustainability."

    The Rio 2016 Organising Committee is continuing to deliver its strategy to make the 2016 Olympic Games as sustainable as possible by signing new agreements guaranteeing that all seafood served at the Games will be sustainably sourced and that all wood purchased by Games organisers will be certified as sustainable.
    The landmark announcements mean that all of the seafood served to the athletes, officials, media and at the on-site restaurants will be wild caught and responsibly farmed, while all wood and forestry products – including overlay structures, furniture, stationery and communication materials – will also be certified.
    Speaking about the seafood agreement, Julie Duffus, Sustainability Manager for the Rio 2016 Organising Committee, said: “This will ensure that our catering not only improves the local food industry but improves it to a standard that will leave a lasting, positive legacy post Games for Rio de Janeiro and Brazil.”
    Regarding the certified wood commitment, Tania Braga, Rio 2016 Head of Sustainability, Accessibility and Legacy, added: “It will be a great opportunity to showcase production and consumption practices that are less harmful to the environment with the use of certified products. We are fully committed to realising this important step for sport and for the country.”
    The Rio 2016 Organising Committee also recently opened its doors to 25 civil society organisations to hear their contributions towards making the Games even more sustainable.
    Approximately 50 representatives took part in the organising committee's first Dialogue Workshop, held on 2-4 December in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The working groups contributed to the revision of the Sustainability Management Plan for the Rio 2016 Games, with proposals for improvements, criticisms and new suggestions. The initiative aims to open a continuous dialogue with civil society and encourage a collective effort to create more sustainable Games.
    “We had an extremely productive three days of work,” said Braga. “I was impressed by the level of preparation, the quality of everything that was presented and the desire to contribute. It's an important step in our efforts to deepen dialogue with society and we can count on the help of all these organisations in the work that is ahead of us. We see a unique opportunity to make the most of the Games' power as a catalyst, to meet the important needs of our society.”

    By Corydon Ireland, Harvard Staff Writer
    Urban wind energy. Beehives. School gardens. Rice farms. These and other suggestions were among a crush of 20 capstone projects presented this week at Harvard Extension School . All offered strategies to slow down growing environmental ills — fitting final efforts by candidates for an A.L.M. (master’s degree) in sustainability and environmental management.
    “They’re very dynamic,” said George D. Buckley of the projects. In May, about 60 students will graduate from a program that has about 325 candidates poised to receive degrees within a year or two. In an average year, he said, roughly 60 percent of students do a capstone project that assesses a real-world problem. The remaining students write a traditional thesis more related to theory.
    The capstone approach — often an immersive experience in the practicalities of changing the environment — is five years old, said Buckley, a 35-year instructor at the Extension School and an assistant director of the Sustainability and Environmental Management Program. As a thesis and capstone adviser, Buckley encounters a flood of final student work three times a year, in fall, spring, and summer. At those same times, capstone projects are shared in a traditional poster session at 51 Brattle St.
    For more than two hours on Tuesday evening, the Grossman Conference Room was crowded with students and well-wishers. (“Behind every thesis or project,” said Buckley, “is a good friend, a spouse, or a parent.”) The program’s students are a composite of the Extension School’s usual demographic: largely older students, most with full-time jobs, and many from far away.
    One candidate, Ian Hayes, is in Cambridge for the semester, but has done most of his coursework online from his home in Zurich. His project was the one on rice cultivation. Thomas Ayers, whose project was on sustainability career pathways, commuted once a week this fall from Florida. Adanna L. Woodson, whose project was sustainability performance at the Department of Defense, did the same from suburban Virginia. Gloriamar Gámez-Menéndez, who offered strategies to counter deforestation, hopes to bring her graduate school skills back to her native Mexico.
    In the past five years, said Buckley, students in the program have come from all 50 states and 50 countries around the world.
    Traditional diversity
    The degree candidates represented more than the geographical reach of the Extension School; they represented the School’s traditional diversity of background and experience. David Havelick came to the program from his full-time job at the Harvard School of Public Health as a project manager for a prostate cancer researcher. His capstone investigation was on school-based gardens. Jay Snyder, whose project looked at systems thinking and the limits to growth, is a computer scientist in the insurance industry.
    Ayers is an educator, Woodson an architect. Mary Light, whose project explores ways corporations can both create wetlands and boost their bottom lines, is a program coordinator with a management strategy company that specializes in environmental issues.
    Jane Murray Wolff, a resident of Boston’s South End, is an insurance industry retiree. Her 90-page capstone project looked at how well Boston is prepared for future sea-level rise, and how concerned some of its citizens are about the possibility of catastrophic urban flooding. (The short answer: not very.) “I’m a financial person,” explained Wolff, “looking for my next lot in life.”
    Among the program’s degree candidates were also a few demographic rarities: full-time students. Maria Melas left a career as a retail analyst to study sustainability. Her project was on the fate of organic materials in municipal solid waste systems. “This is a career change for me,” she said. Jamie Yu signed up for the program after a string of internships, including one at the federal Environmental Protection Agency, where she helped to map food waste generation in the Northeast. Her capstone project looked at how “zero waste” practices are achievable.
    It was Yu who uncovered a universal truth in the course of her project: An institution or government may be educated about sustainability, but it won’t always take action. “They have the theory down, and the words down,” she said, “but not the practice.”
    The same with the Department of Defense, said Woodson, who studied the 2009 federal executive order directing agencies to develop sustainability plans. Some got the message about energy use, waste, and carbon pollution, but others did not, she said. “The government has to work smarter.”
    Some degree candidates worked and took a full-time class load. This semester, Woodson flew from Washington, D.C., to Boston once a week for classes, and took a red-eye flight back every Tuesday. (The program, one of Harvard’s online pioneers, can be completed two-thirds from home, said Buckley, but there is a part-time residency requirement too.) Hectic schedules mean students have to push hard. After her final project is in Monday, Woodson promised herself a break. “I’m going to catch up on all my old TV shows,” she said.
    Intensity and surprise
    Every candidate at the poster presentation agreed on the intensity of the program as an academic experience — even a few, like Light, who were already in the sustainability business.
    Emily J. Reese Moody is a sustainability consultant with a Boston-area engineering group. She is already an expert in LEED, the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program that sets green building standards. But Moody’s capstone project on the social, health, and environmental efficacy of community gardens in her native Memphis, Tenn., uncovered a world of urban sustainability she had barely known. “I know more about Memphis now,” said Moody after completing her 247-page study, “than I ever did living there.”
    She studied 40 community gardens on plots of vacant land in neighborhoods such as Hollywood, Frayser, Uptown, and Orange Mound, that are set on just a fraction of 20,000 acres of candidate garden land within the city. She found that when such gardens were created, crime went down. Moody also made case studies of Baltimore and Detroit. She found that community gardens could help irrigate “food deserts,” neighborhoods without supermarkets, as well as reduce obesity, ease racial tensions, and improve soil, air, and water conditions.
    Moody’s experience illustrated another commonality among the projects, that each offered real-world lessons to families, governments, and institutions willing to listen. Ayers created his green career educational pathways, and a sample curriculum, “so someone doesn’t have to start from scratch.” Wolff’s study of preparedness for rising sea levels sketched a portrait of cities that are studying the problem, but not acting. “Everybody,” she said, “is getting ready to get ready.” These seem like relaxed civic attitudes, considering that by the end of the century Boston-area sea levels could rise more than two feet.
    Snyder offered a similar caution to companies too little aware of the future’s big picture. Predictive analytics and holistic thinking about systems can help evade disaster, he said. Snyder’s case study was Eastman Kodak Co. The onetime imaging giant — now just emerging from bankruptcy — failed to anticipate a digital future that would change cameras and shrink film production, he said, so “They missed the whole moment.”
    Gámez-Menéndez used her capstone project to show how a United Nations mechanism called REDD+ could reduce deforestation in Mexico, which in the 10 years before 2010 lost 7 percent of its forest cover. (REDD+ provides payments to farmers to preserve forests, and their environmental benefits.) Like the other capstone projects, hers revealed facts that surprise. For instance, 44 percent of Mexico is forested. It’s among the top 24 countries with forest biomass that locks up the Earth’s stores of carbon.
    Hayes offered another surprising fact. His project was about options for improving low-yield rice paddies in impoverished areas of Southeast and South Asia. It revealed that rice cultivation of a certain type — on rain-fed lowland paddies — is the leading non-animal agricultural source of methane, a greenhouse gas. It turns out that “rice paddies burp.”
    In her case study of organic waste from a chain of supermarkets in Massachusetts, Melas discovered that the state lacks the infrastructure to handle the 600,000 tons of organic waste that businesses generate each year. And yet these businesses may soon be banned from just putting such waste out with the trash. Meanwhile, Massachusetts law makes it hard to start up more facilities to process organic waste, like anaerobic digesters, she said.
    The successful candidates will graduate in May. At least a few will be looking for jobs. Standing in front of her charts, graphs, and recommendations, Woodson said the program helped her be able to suggest to prospective employers: “Hire me as a consultant.”

    NIAGARA SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVE: Family friendly activities abound in Niagara
    Finding ways to go green in different aspects of your life can also be a great resolution to make, especially as a family. Sometimes, these goals can even help you work toward other efforts, such as getting active and spending time with kids, while saving you money.
    Your family can start with an easy green resolution, and when you have successfully integrated it into your existing routine, move on to another! Here are a couple of examples to get you started:
    Divert Your Waste
    Challenge yourself and your family to get to know the ins and outs of Niagara’s recycling. Familiarize yourself with what goes where and work toward a goal of reducing your garbage by one bag (at least) this year! For help, check out the Region’s thorough list: http://www.niagararegion.ca/living/waste/Item-Disposal.aspx
    Pack Your Reuseable Bags
    Making this a habit is hard! Find a place in your car to stash your reuseable bags and be sure to take them along to the grocery store or the mall. After unpacking your groceries, get in the habit of going to put these bags back in your car, maybe by tying a note to one of them.
    Turn off the Lights
    Using reminder stickers or post it notes in areas where you often forget to turn off the lights can be helpful in achieving this resolution. Also, similar stickers on TV remotes, family computers, as well as your own personal electronics will help save energy & money.
    It’s a perfect time of year for making resolutions. If you are making some, try to green them up, with suggestions from the Niagara Sustainability Initiative. (Photo submitted)
    Walk and Bike More
    St. Catharines’ downtown is one of the most walkable cities in North America. There are other communities in Niagara that also have a number of amenities in walking distance to residents. Looking up directions to a nearby address? Google Maps offers distances and directions for walking and biking to help you plan your time accordingly. Make a resolution to opt for alternative transportation at least once or twice a week.
    Power Down Time
    Bring back electronic-free time with your family. Take a few hours every week to turn off electronics and spend some time with your kids, playing board games, doing a puzzle, or even sitting and doing homework together.
    Short Showers
    Saving water by taking shorter showers can be a hard resolution to work on, especially in the winter when a warm shower can be quite the comfort. Try working toward a four minute shower, which is plenty of time to get clean. Set an egg timer or if you play music in the shower, try to finish up in one song.
    Green Your Eating
    Niagara has an abundance of locally grown food available for sale around the Region – whether at local farmers markets, through co-ops or at stands on the side of the road. Take advantage of these opportunities to eat locally and help to reduce your diet’s footprint. There can be some challenges to eating local in the winter, but next week’s column will help address these, so keep a look out.
    Wishing you and your family a happy and healthy new year from the NSI Team.

  :title: USDA Updates Multi-year Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan - USDA.gov
    (press release) (blog)
  :text: |
    Posted by Dean Johnson, USDA Facilities Energy & Water Program Manager , on December 5, 2013 at 10:00 AM
    Many of the USDA programs touch almost every American, every day.  And as concerns grow about climate change, greenhouse gases and depleting natural resources, USDA continues creating opportunities for farmers, ranchers, forest landowners, public land managers and families in rural communities. These opportunities help these stakeholders generate prosperity in innovative, sustainable ways while conserving the Nation’s natural resources and preventing pollution.
    USDA is committed to leading by example through fostering a clean energy economy, improving the environment by conducting operations in a sustainable and environmentally responsible manner and complying with environmental laws and regulations. To accomplish this, USDA focuses on the future. The Department recognizes the significance of global climate change and utilizes this knowledge to create and maintain conditions under which people and nature can exist in productive harmony.
    Building upon past sustainability efforts, USDA released its 2013 Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, which aligns sustainability goals, greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, and overarching objectives for sustainability with its Strategic Plan. The Sustainability Plan helps USDA meet the targets the President set for agencies in 2009 for reducing energy use, pollution and waste in agency operations, and saving taxpayer dollars as a result.
    Moreover, the Sustainability Plan integrates all statutory and policy requirements into a single implementation framework for advancing sustainability goals together with existing Departmental goals. The Plan makes the best use of existing and available resources. It also includes methods for obtaining data needed to measure progress, evaluate results and improve performance. The Department’s 2013 Plan is an annual update to its first edition, which was developed in June 2010.
    Specifically, the Sustainability Plan provides a review of past performance, addresses challenges to achieving sustainability, discusses lessons learned and outlines actions planned beyond 2013.  So far, USDA has accomplished the following:
    Purchased and generated enough green power to meet 7.3 percent of the Department’s 2012 electricity use.
    17.9 percent reduction in indirect greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 2008 base year.
    5.5 percent reduction in direct greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 2008 base year.
    21.3 percent reduction in energy intensity compared to the 2003 base year.
    11.4 percent of buildings meet the Guiding Principles for Federal High Performance and Sustainable Buildings.
    836.9 percent increase in alternative fuel consumption (for fleet vehicles) compared to the 2005 base year.
    75 percent of the applicable (also known as covered) light duty vehicles USDA acquired are alternative fuel type.
    12.6 percent reduction in potable water use compared to the 2007 base year.
    More information about USDA’s 2013 Strategic Sustainability Plan is at http://www.dm.usda.gov/emd/sspp.htm .

  :title: Major accomplishments in 2013, sustainability in 2014 - Sun.Star
  :text: |
    By Lydia C. Pendon
    Monday, December 30, 2013
    ILOILO City Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog is enthusiastic of the city’s accomplishments and looks forward for sustainability and continuity of development activities, even before the dust of the 2013 midterm and barangay elections settle down during the year.
    “There are no frustrations in 2013 even if detractors continue to throw bitter tomatoes against me and my administration. With an overwhelming success of 15-0 in the May 2013 elections in favor of our political candidates and the support of 179 barangay captains out of 180 barangays in the October elections, we are in for better times,” Mabilog said.
    He said that among his major accomplishments in 2013, public infrastructures take the bulk of accomplishments. These include the public service infrastructures such as the start of the Iloilo Convention Center, La Paz Maternity Clinic upgraded into the Iloilo City Reproductive Health Hospital, the upgraded city slaughterhouse, street widening from Jaro to Leganes and the coastal road, and the road widening along the diversion road.
    The year also saw the massive bullish attraction of private business in investing in the city such as the Ayala Corp., Megaworld, Gaisano, Double Dragon and Injap Corp. and Gaisano Capital.
    Mabilog said year 2014 is essential for sustainability and continuity of activities, adding that the City Government will remain focus on its activities to sustain economic growth.
    Massive infrastructure growth by the government and the private sectors will mark the year. Mabilog said he will try to find a final solution to the water problem besetting the city. He also vowed to work on the city traffic problem.
    For calamity prone areas, the mayor said the city will not allow construction of houses along the river banks and shorelines. The city will look for higher safety places as relocation sites and the public schools and gymnasiums are no longer available as evacuation centers.
    On sports, the City Government is eyeing a sports venue for all the sport activities in the city. On health, the city is planning to increase the financial assistance for hospitalization of indigent families and divert from the paying of increased PhilHealth premiums.
    On education, the city is set to fully implement the K+12 program in 2015-2016 for children.

    Tags: GreenBiz Forum
    Oakland, CA — The GreenBiz Group’s sixth annual GreenBiz Forum will be featured as a cornerstone of Arizona State University’s weeklong celebration of sustainability solutions bringing together global leaders in sustainable business, consumer innovation, renewable energy, science and the arts. The variety of activities, events and audiences reflects the encompassing nature of opportunities in the sustainability arena.
    With the theme, "It’s time to find a better way," the inaugural Sustainability Solutions Festival is convening a series of events Feb. 17-22 that are targeted at a wide variety of audiences, from families and the ASU community to film buffs and leaders of industry. Along with GreenBiz Group, the  Sustainability Consortium  is a featured partner for the Festival, helping to convene leaders of corporate sustainability, civil society and government. Additional community partners include the  Arizona Solar Summit ,  Arizona Science Center ,  Arizona SciTech Festival ,  Sedona Film Festival  and the  City of Tempe .
    “The Sustainability Solutions Festival exemplifies ASU’s endeavor to address the world’s environmental, economic, and social challenges of the 21st century through collaborative, transdisciplinary and solutions-oriented thinking and training,” said Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University. “As citizens of this planet, we have an obligation to future generations to embrace sustainability as a transformational core value in order to develop a society that is more environmentally sensitive, economically disciplined and socially just.”
    The Sustainability Solutions Festival is one of eight programs within the Rob and Melani Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives at the ASU Global Institute of Sustainability. Supported by a generous investment of the Rob and Melani Walton Fund of the Walton Family Foundation, the Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives are designed to use the brightest minds in sustainability science to advance sustainability solutions, accelerate global impact and inspire future leaders.
    “Incredible thinkers, courageous business leaders, dedicated practitioners and distinguished scholars are producing remarkable solutions to sustainability challenges. The Festival will celebrate and promote innovations that will ensure economic prosperity, cultural vitality and environmental resilience for many generations,” said Patricia Reiter, director of the Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives.
    The Festival will kick off on Presidents’ Day, Feb. 17, with two events at the Arizona Science Center in downtown Phoenix. Sustainability Solutions Family Day begins with kid-friendly sustainability demonstrations and ends with a special screening of "Carbon Nation" hosted by the film’s director and producer, Peter Byck. The Sustainability Consortium, a group of global corporations whose founding members include Clorox, BestBuy, Coca Cola and Disney, also will commence their first day of member meetings at the Mission Palms in Tempe to further their aim of improving consumer product sustainability.
    Day two, Feb. 18, is headlined by the opening day for the sixth annual GreenBiz Forum at the Montelucia Resort in Paradise Valley. This three-day conference defines the trends, challenges and opportunities in sustainable business, including the presentation and release of the State of Green Business report. Notable speakers and guests include Mark Tercek (President and CEO of The Nature Conservancy), Peter Bakker (President and CEO of World Business Council for Sustainable Development), Anisa Kamidoli Costa (Chairman and President of The Tiffany & Co. Foundation), Len Sauers (Vice President of Global Sustainability at Procter & Gamble) and Crow, who will deliver the conference’s opening address.
    "The ASU-GreenBiz-Sustainability Consortium partnership, and the terrific program we have planned, are attracting many of the world’s largest companies,” says GreenBiz Group chairman and executive editor Joel Makower. "The registration list is growing at an unprecedented rate and we’re expecting another sell-out event."
    In tandem with the GreenBiz Forum, ASU will be hosting an inaugural GreenBiz shadow conference at the university’s Tempe campus. Combining live streaming of the conference’s program with unique panels and presentations on campus, this shadow conference will allow members of the ASU community an exclusive opportunity to engage in the conference.
    On day three, Feb. 19, the Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives is proud to present the Sustainability Solutions Celebration at the historic Heard Museum in Phoenix. GreenBiz Forum and Sustainability Consortium guests will enjoy local food, drinks and entertainment while exploring the sustainability-oriented practices of Native Americans across North America that are on display throughout the museum.
    The fourth Arizona Solar Summit anchors day four (Feb. 20) at the SkySong Innovation Center in Scottsdale. The summit focuses on introducing innovative policies, programs and technologies critical in reshaping Arizona energy markets.
    Day five, Feb. 21, is devoted to the Sedona Green Film Festival , as the world-renowned Sedona International Film Festival comes to Tempe. Sustainability-themed selections and panel discussions will appeal equally to those who embrace films as well as green practices.
    The Sustainability Solutions Festival closes Feb. 22 in Tempe with Picnic in the Park, a grand community celebration open to the public, designed to honor the spirit of farm-to-table with great food, activities and entertainment for kids and adults.

  :title: Celebrity chefs ranked on seafood sustainability - YottaFire
  :text: |
     •  0 Comments
    Celebrity chefs are encouraging more people to cook with sustainable seafood, but how far do they practise what they preach?
    Researchers from the Environment Department at the University of York ranked the cook books published by ten celebrity chefs between 2005 and 2012 according to the sustainability of the seafood they feature.
    Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall was the front runner throughout the time period, with his books achieving an average score of 87 per cent. In comparison, Delia Smith scored consistently low, between 17 and 22 per cent, and finished at the bottom of the table. Gordon Ramsay, who once encouraged people to eat an endangered fish called orange roughy, rose from bottom of the table in 2007 to third place by 2012. Raymond Blanc, is another chef whose score rose substantially — from 22 per cent to 85 per cent between 2005 and 2011 — reflecting a general improvement in the use of sustainable seafood in the cook books from most chefs in recent years.
    Polly Bowman, who carried out the research as part of her MSc degree in Marine Environmental Management said “Celebrity chefs are a major part of British media culture, and are able to amass formidable book sales. Sales of endorsed products often increase following the release of their books. A chef’s ethical leanings may therefore influence the behaviour of consumers.”
    Dr Bryce Stewart, who supervised the work, added: “We should not shy away from increased promotion of seafood sustainability in popular culture as it offers a potentially important way of reducing pressure on the marine environment. There is increasing evidence that demand for sustainable seafood is leading to improvements in both fisheries management and the health of certain fish stocks. The everyday actions of people in their kitchens really can make a difference to the future of our oceans.”
    Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall said: “I love to cook and eat seafood, and I love to feed it to my family. It’s such great food, and so good for us in so many ways. All the more reason to do what we can to ensure we can continue to eat it for generations to come. Shopping sustainably for fish is not about being perfect and beyond reproach all the time, it’s just about being aware that some choices are a vote for a better way of fishing, and of managing fish resources, and making these choices as often as we can. I’m delighted if my actions are helping to encourage others to think about these issues and make more informed choices when they buy and cook fish.”
    The research team used data from the Marine Conservation Society’s Fishonline website (www.fishonline.org) to score the sustainability of the average gram of seafood in each book. This was combined with a grading of the introduction, recipes and alternative suggested species in each book to produce an overall “sustainability” score.

    Top 10 Sustainable Business Stories of 2013

    Somehow it's already year-end, a time to look back and try to make sense of what's happened. Creating any "top" list of stories from 12 months is nearly impossible. But as I've done for the last 4 years, I'll attempt to summarize some of the latest stories about the big environmental and social pressures on business, and how some innovative companies are dealing with them.
    This year, like recent years, saw some continuation of big trends: with a few exceptions, the international policy community keeps failing to come to a meaningful agreement on climate change; carbon emissions just keep rising , transparency is increasingly unavoidable and keeps gaining technology-enabled traction; pressure from big companies on their suppliers keeps going up.
    So what's really new this year? Let's dive in.
    The Big Picture
    1. The science of climate change gets clearer: the IPCC lowers our carbon "budget."
    The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its wonky, but readable, Summary for Policymakers (a precursor to the full 2014 report). The report expresses "near certainty" that humans are causing climate change and calculates how much more carbon we can "safely" put in the atmosphere and hold to the 2-degree warming threshold that the world's leaders have agreed to (and some scientists are suggesting that even the 2-degree threshold is too high ).
    The short story is that we have less room than before. PwC's annual Low Carbon Economy Index report concluded that we must lower global carbon intensity (the amount of carbon produced for every dollar of GDP) by 6% per year until 2100, a percentage point lower than last year's report recommended. On the upside, similar calculations from WWF and McKinsey suggests that this pace of change -they endorse a 3% reduction in absolute emissions per year through 2020 - will actually be very profitable .
    2. The reality of climate change and pollution get scarier: Australian heat, Philippine devastation, and Chinese air pollution all break records.
    The models and carbon budgets aside, the weather this year got even more extreme, helping make the case for action in a more visceral way. In January, Australia's meteorologists had to add new colors to weather maps to deal with temperatures ranging up to 54 degrees Celsius (129 degrees Fahrenheit). And in November, after the Philippines faced the most powerful storm ever recorded to hit land, some climatologists suggested we add a "Category 6" to the top end of the storm scale.
    While it's impossible to tie any single weather event to climate change, the complicated correlation got clearer this year . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concluded that "high temperatures, such as those experienced in the U.S. in 2012, are now likely to occur four times as frequently due to ­human-induced climate change."
    In parallel, China's air became, at times, dangerous and unbreathable. Several cities experienced days with small-particle air pollution running 25 to 40 times higher than the World Health Organization's recommended limit. This may seem like a regional story, but it has global ramifications for manufacturing, consumer goods, the energy industry, and much more. The world's most populous country is taking increasingly drastic action, such as slashing Beijing's new sales quota for cars by 40% .
    3. The clean tech markets keep growing fast: three of the world's biggest economies -- the U.S., Germany, and Walmart -- add lots more renewable energy.
    In October, 99% of the new energy added to the grid in the U.S. came from renewables (solar alone was 72%). Germany keeps breaking its own records, with wind and solar providing 59% of the country's energy one sunny day in October. And America's wind power has quadrupled over the last 5 years ; wind is now generating enough electricity to power the state of Georgia.
    In addition, electric and hybrid cars are about 4% of US auto sales now, a doubling of market share in the last couple of years. Companies are increasing investments as well. Walmart, already the largest private sector buyer of solar power in the US (with more solar capacity than 38 U.S. states ), committed to a 600% increase in renewable energy by 2020.
    4. Deep concerns about labor conditions, wages, and equity take root: From tragedies in Bangladeshi apparel factories to minimum wages in the U.S.
    Travesties like the death of more than 1100 workers at the Rana Plaza apparel factory in Bangladesh are increasingly unacceptable to the buying public. And it's getting harder to hide how connected we all are to these workers. When the news hit about the loss of life, front pages around the world included the names of major brands that depended on the factory to make their goods. A startup called Labor Voices is now collecting information on working conditions in Bangladesh and elsewhere in a shockingly simple way: by giving workers a number to call from their cell phones, which everybody now has.
    European companies are doing more than U.S. peers, at least publicly, to commit to higher safety standards . Swedish retailer H&M recently said it would pay a "living wage" to 850,000 workers in its supply chain by 2018 - a somewhat vague, but important announcement. And to be fair, while U.S. companies haven't been as clear, Walmart has contracted with Labor Voices to gather data on its 300+ Bangladeshi suppliers and subcontractors.
    On the other side of the ocean, though, Walmart, McDonald's, and many others are facing increasing challenges about minimum wages . Watch this space, as it seems unlikely that this debate will go away.
    5. Food and food waste gets more attention, debate, and innovation: Can cows save the world, or should we make meat in labs?
    The level of concern about how we're going to feed 9 billion people by 2050 is rising. Food waste also got more attention: a UN report estimated that the world throws out $750 billion worth of food annually. Food is too big a topic to summarize, but a few stories grabbed my eye this year. Fenugreen , a smart startup that won the Sustainable Brands Innovation Open in June, sells sheets of paper made with natural ingredients that fight food decay - they can keep fruit and veggies from going bad 2 to 4 times longer than they would last normally.
    On a different front, Biologist Allen Savory made a splash with a much viewed TED talk about how grazing cattle in a way that fertilizes land and sequesters carbon can fight desertification and climate change. His theory is under attack , at least to the extent that his method could make asignificant dent in our climate problem. Wherever the science on this ends up, it's an important discussion that brings more focus to systems thinking and to the nexus of food, energy, and water. Finally, a quirky, totally different meat story was fascinating. Billionaires Bill Gates and Sergey Brin are funding experiments to grow meat in labs, a process that - once people get past any "ick" factor - could greatly reduce the footprint of producing meat-based protein.
    What Companies Are Doing
    6. (Some) businesses get off the sidelines in the climate policy fight: Hundreds of companies sign onto the Climate Declaration.
    Started by the NGO Ceres, as part of its Business for Innovative Climate & Energy Policy (BICEP) initiative, the Climate Declaration is a broad statement of intent that acting on climate will be good for our economy and society. A large range of leading companies have signed on including Diageo, ebay, EMC, Gap, GM, IKEA, Intel, Microsoft, Nestle, Nike, Portland Trailblazers, Starbucks, Swiss Re, Unilever, and many more. The Declaration itself is directional and not as specific as what Ceres and a subset of these signatories advocate for as part of BICEP's work (like pricing carbon and aggressive energy efficiency programs). But it's a very good start and demonstrates that the business community is not against tackling climate change.
    In related news, Accenture produced a fascinating survey of 1000 CEOs around the world, in which a surprising 83% agreed that government should play a critical role in enabling the private sector to advance sustainability. And 31% even supported "intervention through taxation." In a world where business generally fights all regulations and government interventions, it's astonishing that one third of global CEOs basically said, "tax us."
    7. Companies are aiming higher, for themselves and their partners: Dell, Coca-Cola, Lego, and many more set very aggressive environmental and social goals.
    Goals are not the same as outcomes but they matter a lot - they set the bar within sectors, driving competition and performance. As part of its 2020 Legacy of Good Plan , Dell said that it's aiming to get a 10-fold multiple of good (reduced footprint, for example) from its technologies versus the impacts of making them (mimicking BT's earlier 3:1 "Net Good" goal). More specifically, the company pledged to reduce its greenhouse gases by 50% and product energy intensity by 80%.
    Coca-Cola launched its own 2020 goals including reducing value chain carbon emissions by 25% (per drink), recovering 75% of bottles and cans, and replenishing 100% of the water the company uses. And Lego just announced its intention to use 100% renewable energy by 2016 . A few companies have already made incredible progress, including Diageo, which, I reported earlier this year , cut its North American GHG emissions by nearly 80%.
    In fact, 75% of the world's largest companies now have multiple environmental and social goals in place (see my new website, www.pivotgoals.com , a searchable database of 2500 environmental and social goals set by the world's largest companies). In addition, my research shows that more than 50 of the top 200 companies have even set carbon goals in line with PwC's 6% per year reduction recommendation.
    A few companies have begun to extend their goals to their suppliers, a form of what I'm calling "de facto regulation." Walmart is phasing out 10 toxic chemicals in the products on its shelves, and HP set a carbon reduction goal of 20% for its supply chain.
    8. Sustainable companies are winning the talent wars: Unilever ranks 3rd in LinkedIn's list of in-demand employers.
    Just consider LinkedIn's top 20 most in demand companies (in order): Google, Apple, Unilever, P&G, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, PepsiCo, Shell, McKinsey, Nestlé, Johnson & Johnson, BP, GE, Nike, Pfizer, Disney, Coca-Cola, Chevron, and L'Oréal. The tech companies make sense given the platform (and they're cool brands). But the rest are perennially in-demand employers, such as big consumer brands and top destinations for MBAs (McKinsey) and engineers (Shell).
    But what's surprising is Unilever's rank -- for a company not nearly as well known as the others, it came in just behind two of the hottest, most valuable companies in the world, and ahead of much better known brands like Disney, Nike, and Coca-Cola. Executives at Unilever credit their ranking to the company's known leadership on sustainability. It's hard to argue the point.
    9. Systems innovation starts to take root: NIKE, NASA, USAID, and the Department of State create LAUNCH.
    LAUNCH is an initiative to identify and accelerate innovations that help solve global problems with water, health, energy, waste, and systems. This program is new so it's unclear what the impact will be, but it's an interesting and indicative story for two reasons. First, look at the partners -- what a weird, wonderful mix of business, government, and scientific organizations. Second, the goal is really systems change, and if we're going to solve the mega challenges in our midst, we need to work across value chains and traditional lines.
    10. Better tools for companies to assess "materiality" get closer: SASB releases its first sustainability accounting standards.
    The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board has been plugging away, drawing together executives from the world's largest companies to develop the right sets of questions - specific to each sector - that will help leaders identify which environmental and social issues are really material to their business. We're very early in this journey, but SASB produced the first set of guidelines for one sector (health care). Watch this space.
    2014 and Beyond
    Will the divestment movement continue to gather steam and put significant pressure, either financial (unlikely) or moral (much more intriguing), on fossil fuel companies?
    Will all the talk about building a circular economy gain mainstream acceptance?
    Will we get better at valuing natural capital (and will companies and markets care)? It certainly garnered lots of attention this year, with new estimates of the damage the global economy does to natural assets (trillions), new tools to measure natural capital , and an important new book from former Goldman partner and CEO of The Nature Conservancy, Mark Tercek .
    Can challenges to our consumption-driven model go gain currency? Patagonia continues to launch programs like its Responsible Economy initiative and a backlash to Black Friday, "Worn Wear," which suggests that we should enjoy what we already own.
    Will the resilience push take hold? New York City released a $20 billion plan to get the city ready for more extreme weather -- will companies embrace the risk-reduction benefits of different thinking and planning?
    Finally, why haven't more companies followed some of the recent sustainability leaders? Paul Polman at Unilever stopped providing quarterly guidance a few years ago so the company could focus on real value creation. And Microsfot and Disney remain really the only two big companies charging their own divisions a carbon fee (yes, as CDP recently reported, and the New York Times put on the front page , 29 large companies now use some kind of internal pricing for carbon. But most of these are "shadow prices," in use for years, not actual fees. Why has the pace of change lagged the urgency of our mega challenges? Will more than a small number of companies embrace a much deeper change to business as usual?
    So it's been a mixed year, as I suppose all years are, but I remain optimistic that greater stories of change are coming. Have a very happy, healthy, and sustainable 2014!

  :title: The Mystery of the 50 Angolan Sustainability Reports - Triple Pundit
  :text: |
    Tweet
    By Elaine Cohen 
    KPMG published its  2013 Survey of Corporate Responsibility Reporting  recently. For a reporting geek like me, that’s like getting five helpings of ice-cream all at once. A positive feast of information all about reports. I love it.
    I am still working through the entire thing (gotta do a little work once in a while) but there is something that struck me as rather mentionworthy.
    Angola.
    How many sustainability reports get published in Angola?  In the  GRI reports database , there is not a single report from Angola since the start of the database. I looked in the  CorporateRegister.com  database, and there are 10 reports from 3 companies in Angola published between 2007 and 2011. Nothing in 2012 or 2013. Even the UN Global Compact has no participants from Angola.
    So how is it that, in the KPMG survey, 50 percent of the top 100 companies in Angola are noted as reporting on CSR?
    That’s a higher rate than 6 other countries: South Korea, New Zealand, Greece, UAE, Kazakhstan and Israel.
    click to enlarge
    Not only that, in the KPMG survey, Angola is way up there with the GRI-based reporting leader companies, with over 80 percent of these mystery Angolan reports being GRI-based.
    In the  CorporateRegister.com  database, I can find 16 reports from Kazakhstan, and as many as 585 reports from South Korea, with the other countries in between. So, how come Angola has achieved a 50 percent reporting rate? There is no stock exchange in Angola,  as this is scheduled for 2016 .
    The KPMG methodology looks at the top 100 national companies in each country. A 50 percent reporting rate means that 50 of the top 100 companies in Angola have publicly disclosed their corporate responsibility performance in some form of corporate responsibility or sustainability report.
    So where are all these reports? This is a mystery. I love mysteries. Just call me Agatha.
    Angola has a population of just over 18 million people living in an area of 1.2 million sq. km. Portuguese is the official language and Luanda is the capital. Angola’s main claim to fame is its oil, with an OPEC quota of 1.65 million barrels per day. GDP per capita is $6,500 which ranks 144 in the world league table. There are only 9.4 million mobile telephones in use, so that’s an opportunity for the telco sector, and only 0.6 million internet users, an even bigger opportunity. Human trafficking, drugs and forced labor in agriculture are mentioned as some of the transnational issues that Angola must address. The country has some spectacular sights and  Kalandula Falls  seems like it should be on everybody’s visit-here-some-day list.
    Doing business in Angola, according to the World Bank Group , is not a piece of cake, and Angola ranks low on the easy-peasy scale. In fact,  Forbes recently gave Angola the big thumbs down  as one of the worst 5 countries in the world to do business in. This is a great opportunity, therefore, for CSR and sustainability.
    However, when checking out the ice-cream scene in Angola, all I came up with was a list of  ice-cream parlors in Angola, IN,  which last time I checked, was in the U.S.  Maybe that’s the Angola that’s in the KPMG survey?
    But I am still wondering, where are those 50 reports? Now, now, Agatha, don’t give up just yet.
    I tried to find a reliable list of the largest 100 companies in Angola.  Wikipedia lists a few notable companies in Angola . 36 companies to be exact. Are these the companies in the KPMG N100 list? Where are the remaining 64?
    I shot off an email to the folks at KPMG to see if they could shed any light on the Angola mystery. Here’s what they had to say: “Angolese companies included in the research in many cases are subsidiaries of large global companies that issue CR reporting in other countries (for example, Total, who publishes a group report in France). As all subsidiaries are included in such group reports, they count at the local (Angola) level as well, including the reference to the GRI.”
    Mystery solved. Sort of. Apparently Angola’s reporting rate of 50 percent is entirely made up of global companies operating a subsidiary in that country. Ditto for other countries. No wonder the N100 global reporting rate is 71 percent. I wonder what it would be if KPMG took out the reports that were not written by companies headquartered in the countries surveyed. Any guesses?

    The Mayan's got it wrong. 2013 was not the year it all came to an end. But reflecting on the year it was one where sustainability has been slowed by the continuing economic and political turmoil I wrote about on this site one year ago . To be more precise, we've suffered from political and economic short termism and an unedifying scramble back to the pre-2008 business as usual model that proved so destructive for sustainability.
    So what about 2014? It's that time of year when we reflect on the last 12 months and look forward to the year ahead. At this time I'm often asked for my predictions. Predictions is a dangerous game and to be honest crystal balls, tea leaves and lines on the palm of your hand ain't going to be much use. I prefer to talk about my hopes because, as Albert Einstein said, "learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow" and I have much hope for tomorrow.
    Hope that those businesses that are showing leadership in sustainability will continue to increase their pace and scale. And they'll be joined by a civil society that truly finds its voice. Hope that politicians will begin to wise up; because the former two will make them.
    Hope that those businesses that are leading the charge, and there are many great examples, will start to move from minimising their negative impacts to maximising their positive ones. Ideas such as Ian Cheshire's Net Positive vision, which goes beyond tackling resource efficiency, deforestation and energy use and looks to replace more forests and generate more energy than it consumes. This type of commitment will become the norm and be the main focus of sustainable business discussions next year.
    Hope that the business laggards will begin to get with the programme. Why? Because it's the right thing to do and because, like those that are leading, it will finally dawn on them that it is the only way to run a business of the future.
    Hope that business will be vocal critics of politicians. I don't mean by joining the trendy Russell Brand dystopian band wagon but rather progressive business leaders saying, "we've grown up and are building hope for tomorrow, now you need to too." As Paul Polman wrote on the Rainforest Alliance blog at the beginning of 2013, "the current system is broken. Indeed, to think otherwise would be an injustice. As the gap between rich and poor is growing ever wider – millions are left behind; struggling to earn a living and fulfil their everyday health and hygiene needs."
    So no more government shut downs or use of high energy costs to rip the heart out of green, decarbonisation and fuel poverty reduction programmes. Instead work with us to forge a sustainable future in which business does well because people do well. And both do well because the planet is well.
    Hope that as consumers, citizens and voters we say; no more. We have aspirations for a better tomorrow, for a better life but what's currently on offer isn't it. We don't want to pay the price any more. We want sustainable goods and services that tread lightly on the earth. We want unsustainable goods to cost more because they do more damage and we're tired of paying for their externalities. We want new rules to play the game by.
    Those are my hopes for 2014. Hope; that feeling of desire for something and the confidence in the possibility of its fulfilment. That is what I will be working for and that is why I'll be bringing together some of the world's most progressive CEOs: to realise the possibility of its fulfilment.

    Two sustainability targets getting little progress in Grand Rapids both related to sidewalk construction.AP File Photo 
    GRAND RAPIDS, MI – City staff are reporting progress on more than 99 percent of the goals set forth in a 5-year sustainability plan. But progress is lacking on two of the plan’s 233 targets:
    • Develop an additional 2 miles of new sidewalks by June 30, 2015
    • Add one-quarter mile of new sidewalks on major or regional streets annually
    “Additional miles of new sidewalk are not part of the forecast, and will not be, until additional funding is secured,” states the report posted here .
    Grand Rapids plans to address sidewalk construction during a “second phase” of its ongoing transformation, which figures on voter approval of a proposed streets tax. City Commission in January will consider putting an income tax for streets on the May ballot.
    "If the (tax proposal) passes it will certainly help to make significant progress on both of those targets," said Haris Alibasic, the city's director of energy and sustainability.

    BISBEE — When the new city council members and mayor took office a year ago, one of the additions they made to the commissions and boards was the Bisbee Sustainability Commission.
    Charged with balancing ecological health, social equity and economic welfare, commission members Ryan Bruce, Meggen Connolley, Earl Doane, Maggie Kohanek, Serena Sullivan and Michael Turisk have taken on the challenge to promote these ideals and introduce a more holistic way of moving the city forward while maintaining its historical nature.
    In a meeting held Dec. 23, Bruce, Connolley, Kohanek, Sullivan and Doane briefly discussed the draft sustainability plan they would follow.

    Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week to focus on energy, water, waste management
    Winners of the Zayed Future Energy Prize will also be announced during event
    Staff Report
    Published: 17:53 December 28, 2013
    Abu Dhabi: The second edition of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) will focus on the interconnected challenges and opportunities of sustainable growth, with particular focus on the energy-water nexus and sustainable waste management.
    ADSW and its participating conferences and exhibitions will take place in Abu Dhabi from January 18-24, the organiser of the event, Masdar, Abu Dhabi’s renewable energy company, announced.
    With the global population now exceeding seven billion, managing the world’s resources is critical for future generations, a Masdar press release said.
    As one of the largest gatherings on sustainability in the world, the ADSW is driving progress on energy, water and waste issues. The international platform offers an opportunity for public and private sector decision makers, investors and innovators to address sustainable development. It also encourages investments related to the adoption of renewable energy, efficient water technologies and waste management solutions.
    As global energy and political leaders continue to debate effective avenues for sustainable growth, the need to harmonise the defining factors of sustainability — environmental, social and economic — remains at the heart of the discussion.
    Managing resources
    “Over the past year, sustainable growth has been at the top of the global agenda. By 2030, as many as five billion people will live in cities which will require us to efficiently manage resources, such as water, energy and waste,” Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, chief executive officer of Masdar, said.
    Water, energy and waste are at the core of the discussions at ADSW. The United Nations has estimated that half of the world’s global citizens could face water shortages by 2030, when demand for water could exceed supplies by 40 per cent. With only three per cent of the world’s water suitable for human needs, more solutions — which could open the doors for innovations and businesses — are necessary to sustain a growing population.
    Meanwhile, the world’s consumption of energy is set to increase 56 per cent by 2040, and countries must capitalise on all of their energy sources to create more balanced and resilient energy portfolios. In addition to water and energy, waste management has become a progressively important factor in sustainable growth, and is increasingly considered a path to additional economic opportunities. While some 3.5 billion people, half the world’s population, lack crucial waste management services, the global waste market, from collection to recycling, is estimated at $410 billion (Dh1.5 trillion) a year.
    “Harmonising environmental, social and economic sustainability objectives are critical in supporting global development,” Dr Al Jaber said.
    Dr Al Jaber added: “The UAE is a key contributor to the dialogue, and a recognised driver of innovation and sustainable technological development. We look forward to advancing the conversation and encouraging investments in the field of sustainability.”
    Irena assembly
    ADSW will begin with the fourth Assembly of the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena). The world’s first intergovernmental organisation dedicated to renewable energy, Irena is headquartered in Abu Dhabi and counts 163 states among its members. The assembly takes place from January 18-19.
    The World Future Energy Summit (WFES), the International Water Summit (IWS) and the EcoWASTE exhibition will follow at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (Adnec) from January 20-22, 2014.
    WFES, now in its seventh year, is the world’s foremost event dedicated to the advancement of renewable energy, energy efficiency and clean technology. The conference programme and exhibition will engage political, business, financial, academic and industry figures on the deployment of renewable energy. It will also engage these leaders in business opportunities within the renewables sector, and will stress the need to continue driving innovation and investment to diversify the global energy mix. More than 650 companies have already registered to exhibit during WFES.
    The second edition of the International Water Summit (IWS) will address the energy-water nexus, scarcity, sustainable growth and economic development in arid regions, and the future challenges of water availability. It will also promote international collaboration on water governance to address the water-energy nexus.
    EcoWASTE, taking place during ADSW for the first time in partnership with Abu Dhabi’s Centre of Waste Management, will highlight progress in waste-to-energy technology, and discuss its wide-spread adoption as a viable, long-term contributor to a balanced energy approach.
    Renewable energy
    Winners of the Zayed Future Energy Prize will also be announced during ADSW, at an awards ceremony on January 20. The prize, worth $4 million, was established by the UAE leadership to recognise and reward excellence in renewable energy and sustainability across the globe.
    Reinforcing Abu Dhabi’s role as a diversified energy leader, ADSW is expected to welcome over 30,000 delegates and visitors from more than 150 countries.

  :title: 'The seed of sustainability: How President Coleman''s green initiative is
    taking ... - The Michigan Daily'
  :text: |
    New sustainability initiatives discussed by lead faculty body
    In a 2011 address, Coleman re-emphasized the importance of sustainable practices by announcing the results of an Integrated Assessment, which investigated and suggested improvements for the University and made a $14 million investment toward four main areas on campus: climate action, waste prevention, healthy environments and community awareness.
    She then set University-wide goals in each of the areas to be reached by 2025, including cutting greenhouse emissions by 25 percent and purchasing 20 percent of all University food from local and sustainable sources — a goal that has already been reached.
    To say that the University’s focus on sustainability has flourished since Coleman made it a priority would be an understatement. Though measuring progress on the sustainability initiative is often more subjective than whether or not the campus smoking rate has declined or more students are studying abroad — two of Coleman’s other initiatives — fiscal year 2013 marked the sixth consecutive year that energy conservation measures saved millions of dollars, according to an annual energy consumption report. While public funding for many projects has decreased in recent years, the amount of sustainability research-related funding has increased by 200 percent since 2003.
    Don Scavia, director of the Graham Environmental and Sustainability Institute and special counsel to the president on sustainability, said since Coleman placed an emphasis on the issue, projects at the University have begun snowballing, and students have become more active than ever in sustainability initiatives. The Graham Institute’s mission is to bring facets of campus together on sustainability initiatives.
    The difference even in just two years, he said, is marked — evident in the growth of institutes, enterprises, departments, student programs and clubs at the University dedicated to sustainable practices.
    “There are very few places that have the kind of programs we do here at Michigan, at the scale we have here,” Scavia said. “Michigan is so well-positioned to deal with it.”
    But student efforts are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to implementing tangible, eco-friendly solutions. The growing sustainability culture on campus addresses operations, construction and behaviors, as well as undergraduate and graduate programming. The “green” efforts have touched the University of Michigan Health System and the Michigan Athletic Department facilities, all of which have been influenced by the president’s ambitious sustainability goals.
    Scavia said Coleman was moved to take action after she realized that the environment would be the defining issue for this generation.
    “It’s critically important. It’s the kind of thing we can’t do casually — we have to focus on it,” Scavia said.
    On campus
    There are 640 sustainability-related courses offerings at the University, reaching across departments from the School of Art & Design to the Ross School of Business, according to the 2012 sustainability report. The Program in the Environment major, often called PitE, has been the fastest growing concentration at the University for six years, according to Scavia, and a minor in sustainability was added last year to meet demand from students interested in the topic.
    Faculty across campus have incorporated sustainability into their courses, an interdisciplinary approach that is critical if the University wants to continue to prioritize sustainability, according to Coleman.
    “Sustainability is an area that presents some of the most complex problems we face — challenges that no single discipline will solve,” Coleman said in a recent statement to The Michigan Daily. “We’ve positioned our approach to be broad, including key research activities and educating students how to apply sustainability to all fields for the greatest impact.”
    Mike Shriberg, the educational director of the Graham Institute and a Program in the Environment professor, said Coleman’s prioritization of sustainability allowed professionals and campus leaders interested in the issue to pursue projects and research that otherwise may not have come to fruition. While many programs at the University have begun incorporating sustainability into their courses, broadening the interdisciplinary approach to all corners of campus is his next objective.
    Shriberg has been involved in sustainability issues on campus for 15 years. He said in the past, there were “pockets of good activity,” such as recycling and energy conservation measures.

  :title: Telecoupling science shows China's forest sustainability packs global impact
    - Science Daily (press release)
  :text: " Share\nTelecoupling Science Shows China's Forest Sustainability Packs Global
    Impact\nDec. 19, 2013 \x97 As China increases its forests, a Michigan State University
    (MSU) sustainability scholar proposes a new way to answer the question: if a tree
    doesn't fall in China, can you hear it elsewhere in the world?\nShare This:\nIn
    this week's journal Asia and the Pacific Policy Studies, MSU's University Distinguished
    Professor Jianguo \"Jack\" Liu dissects the global impact of China's struggle
    to preserve and expand its forests even as its cities and population balloon.\nBecause
    China's supersized global role makes each domestic decision a world event, Liu
    shows how China's efforts to sustain forests influences other countries, and in
    turn how those changes may rebound to China. He is the author of \"Forest Sustainability
    in China and Implications for a Telecoupled World.\"\n\"For a long time, many
    scientists have focused specifically on one place to understand environmental
    impact, but that no longer is enough,\" said Liu, the director of MSU's Center
    for Systems Integration and Sustainability and the Rachel Carson Chair in Sustainability.
    \"Economic development and environmental conservation in one place are increasingly
    having substantial influence elsewhere, and spill over into places we don't consider.\"\nDeforestation
    that eases in China tends to reappear in the countries that sell them lumber and
    food to meet their ravenous appetite for housing and furniture as well as food.
    But Liu notes that that's just the beginning. He deploys the telecoupling framework
    -- a new multidisciplinary research tool that embraces the minutia of give and
    take. Telecoupling is socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances.
    It goes beyond the idea of connection, as telecoupling factors in actions and
    reactions over distances.\nIn the past three decades, China has succeeded in increasing
    its forest cover. Sweeping policies that limit logging or encourage returning
    farmland to forest are credited with some of the success. Importing food, such
    as soybean and meat, and forest products like timber or wood furniture, also contributes.
    But that seems to have caused forests to decline in the countries selling the
    forest goods to China, as well as a spray of other impacts.\nImporting food to
    China can allow more land to be returned to forest in China, yet when food demand
    from China becomes higher, farmers in other countries such as Brazil have more
    incentive to mow forests down or intensify agriculture by applying more fertilizers
    and pesticides.\nLiu has introduces the telecoupling framework as an integrated
    way to understand how distance is shrinking and connections are strengthening
    between nature and humans.\nLiu also shows there's more to this than trade. He
    points out how growing foreign investment in China has led to more houses, factories
    and infrastructure, all of which carve into forests. Even getting smarter -- and
    sharing knowledge and technology more freely -- can benefit or harm forests. Spreading
    the message of environmental protection can be a forest's friend, while spreading
    knowledge of technology can make powerful, efficient machinery available that
    harvests forests more efficiently.\nAnd telecoupling science also allows scientists
    to consider \"spillover\" systems -- the countries that are left out of the direct
    equations of trade between China and its partners in food and forest goods, but
    who produce the machinery to harvest and transport timber, or process timber,
    or even are home to routes for smugglers.\n\"The days of simply looking at sustainability
    at one place are over,\" Liu said. \"We need to understand how the world really
    works and acknowledge that the world isn't as big and disconnected as we sometimes
    treat it. \"\nShare this story on Facebook, Twitter, and Google:\nOther social

  :title: Sustainability research, collaboration benefits campus community - Diamondback
    Online
  :text: |
    by Erin Serpico
    As the field of environmental research grows nationally, this university has worked to increase opportunities for scientists, resulting in a successful semester for campus sustainability initiatives.  
    From research breakthroughs to decreasing carbon emissions, this university has been applauded for its green efforts this semester with awards, grants and national media attention. But the impact of these successes, driven by the university’s collaborative research environment, is felt on the campus as well, with more opportunities for student involvement and a heightened awareness of sustainable practices. 
    Patrick O’Shea, chief university research officer, said he attributes the success to interdisciplinary collaboration, something the university hopes to continue fostering as researchers seek to understand the environment in College Park and beyond university borders. 
    “It’s important to integrate these areas together and take a look at the big picture and the big issues,” O’Shea said. “We look at problems in the context of another.”
    Emerging popular research topics connect to how we feed, fuel, house and heal people “in a sustainable environment that’s safe and free,” O’Shea said.
    Mark Stewart, sustainability office senior project manager, said there is a high demand for environmental research on the federal level. More research funds are available for universities and institutions to create research centers, which benefits the campus. The sustainability office initiatives generally start with a research project, Stewart said, which can be implemented to meet the growing interest in sustainability on the campus. 
    “[Researchers] often on the cutting edge of new groundbreaking research that wind up influencing things we’ll install on campus,” Stewart said. “The work that they do influences the industry and its knowledge.”
    This university’s Energy Research Center, the Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center and the Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center are examples, O’Shea said. And most recently, the NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction, which opened last year in College Park, added diversity with a new crop of meteorologists.
    “We’ve always been involved in trying to make energy more sustainable. The biggest footprint has been the energy consumption for the campus,” said Eric Wachsman, an engineering professor and UMERC director. “That’s probably the most critical issue that’s going to face us. It’s the impact of energy on water and water on energy.”  
    The university passed the first milestone in its Climate Action Plan — reducing carbon emissions by 15 percent by 2012 — this year, which officials said is one example of successful synergy. 
    These collaborations have also given students more chances to get involved. As a member of the sustainability council and the university’s council on the environment, Wachsman said the sustainability council works to improve on-campus sustainability based on daily behaviors and student projects. 
    The creation of the university’s Council on the Environment two years ago also helped integrate research efforts. The council oversees projects dealing with environmental research on the campus, Stewart said. In keeping track of ways to improve the lives of others, on or off the campus, O’Shea said they hope to continue making progress toward a sustainable world. 
    “It’s really important to see what we can do that can create a sustainable place for people,” O’Shea said. “What we do and people do around the world impacts each other.”

    Incorporating Sustainability Across The Supply Chain
    Fri, 12/06/2013 - 9:58am

    Sustainability is a hot topic in the food and beverage industry. As manufacturers seek to reduce costs and maintain customer loyalty, implementing sustainable practices can help to achieve these aims while at the same time ensuring that companies are playing a responsible role in their industry and society in general.
    According to the UK’s Food and Drink Federation , “The global food system is coming under increasing pressure from the impacts of climate change, population increase, a growing demand for limited resources and changing diets.” The organization’s research indicates that consumers are also increasingly seeking reassurance that businesses are managing their supply chains sustainably. There is, therefore, a growing realization across the industry that building a secure and sustainable supply chain not only makes good business sense, but also has the potential to bring with it a number of additional benefits: demonstrating a company’s commitment to wider stakeholder and societal interests, building a more resilient supply chain, and stimulating innovation, which results in increased productivity and meeting customer demands.
    Today, food and beverage manufacturers are incorporating sustainable practices in a number of different ways. These can include a wide variety of activities and initiatives, including streamlining logistics to minimize emissions in transport, reverting to packaging materials that are made of recycled or recyclable materials, auditing the utility usage at their facilities, as well as investing in energy-efficient machinery.
    The global regulatory landscape is shifting to accommodate this drive towards improved sustainability, supported in many cases by the efforts of major retailers to incorporate sustainable practices into their guidelines. For example, in the U.S., Walmart’s long established Sustainability Scorecard rates and ranks the green efforts of the companies in its supply chain. By examining aspects of its supplier business including greenhouse gas emissions, utility and water usage, the sustainability of packaging materials and waste management, among others, the retail giant calculates an overall sustainability score for suppliers and thereby encourages further improvements across its supply chain. Similarly, leading European supermarket chain Sainsbury’s has invested heavily in its 20x20 Sustainability Plan, which includes a commitment that by 2020, Sainsbury’s suppliers also will be leaders in meeting or exceeding the company’s social and environmental standards. This plan incorporates targets for significantly reducing carbon emissions across the supply chain.
    These clear retailer guidelines, combined with a variety of region-specific government standards, are encouraging and enabling a new generation of sustainable best practice across the world. For example, in May 2012, South Korea became the first country in Asia to introduce a national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trading scheme (ETS). The ETS will commence in 2015, and aims to reduce the country’s emissions by 30 percent by 2020. To achieve this, the country’s manufacturing businesses will need to reevaluate their production operations and practices. [2]
    Small parts, big impact
    To be truly sustainable, an increasing number of manufacturers are looking further into the supply chain at the suppliers of the parts and equipment used on an everyday basis in their plants. By working with partners that understand the importance of sustainability, manufacturers can further improve their credentials at every point of the supply chain. These suppliers drive their own sustainable initiatives across the production of the systems that are used in the manufacture of food and beverage products. Utilizing sustainability-enhancing equipment and components can add up to a significant impact.
    Take flexible tubing, for example. Flexible tubing can come into contact with beverage and food products at several points along the supply chain, beginning with transfer applications at the processing stage and ending with applications in beverage or condiment dispensers found at many restaurants and fast-food chains. Just like CPGs, these institutions are aware of their environmental footprint and continuously strive to meet sustainability goals.
    Many tubing products are comprised of a fossil-fuel based phthalate called di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), a plasticizer used to give tubing its flexibility. Recent studies suggest DEHP may be responsible for negative environmental and human health impacts . Already on the EU’s REACH candidate list of substances of very high concern (SVHC) and California’s OEHHA Proposition 65 List of chemicals of concern , many industries, consumers and governments are putting limitations on the use of this chemical in certain applications.
    As part of the company’s commitment to sustainability, Saint-Gobain recently launched Tygon S3™, a bio-based, non-phthalate tubing for food and beverage dispensing and transfer applications. This safe, smart and sustainable solution provides high level performance in delivering clarity, product consistency and taste-odor free properties associated with the Tygon®brand of tubing, but with a forward-looking formulation to addresses the needs of evolving regulatory requirements. Being phthalate-free means the potential human health and environmental impacts during the tubing’s use are reduced. Companies that use Tygon S3 will have reduced exposure to risk or liability for their business and brands with the anticipated regulations on products containing phthalates like DEHP in food or beverage dispensing, processing, and transfer applications.
    Captain Planet said it best: The power is yours
    Proving truly sustainable credentials involves in-depth testing and documentation. In many ways, sustainability is about choices — giving manufacturers and the consumers they serve the choice to select a more sustainable and environmentally friendly solution or product. By committing to being transparent about its sustainable initiatives and providing documentation of these initiatives, ideally from an independent reviewer, companies can build trust in their supply chains and offer this choice to their target markets. Moreover, by working in partnership with suppliers who are implementing the same best practices, a company can ensure the long-lasting impact of the sustainable practices it is implementing throughout the supply chain.

    Skanska USA announced it has promoted Elizabeth Heider to the new position of chief sustainability officer, effective January 1. In this role, she will lead Skanska’s efforts to work in ways that support the triple bottom line of sustainability -- environmental, social and economic health. 
    Heider has a 12-year tenure with Skanska, primarily as senior vice president for green markets with Skanska USA Building. She founded Skanska’s  National Green Council and has been a key consultant with clients on how they can build facilities more sustainably.
    Skanska made news in July when, following a year of dispute, it unabashedly announced that it withdrew its membership of the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce  in protest of a chemical industry-led initiative to effectively ban the future use of LEED for government buildings.
    Heider is heavily involved with the U.S. Green Building Council , serving as the chair of the organization’s board of directors in 2012. An advocate for leading-edge green building practices, Heider has been a part of major research studies, such as the Living Building Financial Study and the Preservation Green Lab ’s study that showed the benefits of green retrofits of existing buildings.

  :title: Government to start assessing the sustainability of local councils - Lusaka
    Times
  :text: |
      Print This Post |
    Local Government and Housing Minister Emerine Kabanshi
    The Ministry of Local Government and housing will next year start assessing the sustainability of councils with a view to come up with solutions to the numerous challenges being face including payment of salaries.
    Local Government and Housing Minister Emerine Kabanshi disclosed this in an interview with ZANIS in Lusaka today.
    She said the move has been necessitated by some councils failure to meet their obligations especially payment of salaries to workers.
    Ms Kabanshi disclosed that some Councils’ failure to pay salaries to workers in division four despite government having taken up the responsibility of paying officers falling in divisions one to three is purely as a result of lack of innovation on their part.
    She said there is no justification as to why Councils should fail to pay only a section of workers when government had lightened their burden of salary payments.
    Ms Kabanshi said her Ministry is currently developing a tool that will be used in assessing the councils.
    “This problem of Councils has been there for a long time, so to solve these problems needs an assessment and currently we are developing a tool to use in the assessment,” she said.
    The Minister said taking one approach of bailing out the councils is not the best solution because different councils require different interventions.
    She said in some cases, the Minister will have to build the human resource capacity to perform while other councils will just need to be more innovative in order to raise enough revenue than what they are collecting presently.
    “A lot of councils have potential but they just lack innovation, so we will solve these problems depending on the findings, if it is a human resource problems, then we will need to get people that will make the council tick,” she said.
    The Minister was reacting to some councils failure to pay salaries for workers in division four.
    The Ministry of Local Government has taken up the burden of paying salaries for management and administrative staff only in councils.

    When the Weinreb Group released our latest report, " Pioneers of Sustainability: Lessons from the Trailblazers ", the outpouring of feedback regarding the gender imbalance of the Six Pioneers surprised me.
    All of them were white men. When  James Epstein-Reeves and I first developed the report, we predicted the gender outcome, but not the readers' response to it.
    Clearly, something went wrong. In this article, I want to dive deeper into the data to identify how feminists such as us could author a report highlighting the achievements of six men and no women.
    We first need to look at the gender balance along the three steps of the process: the nominators, the candidates they nominated and for whom they voted.
    Gender balance during the nomination process
    Only 31 percent of CSOs surveyed were women: The bias started at the very beginning of the project. To develop our Pioneers list, [ PDF ] we contacted the 35 chief sustainability officers identified in the Weinreb Group's 2013 "CSO Updated List" [PDF] . Of these 35 CSOs, 11 (31 percent) are women.
    We asked the CSOs to nominate the individuals they considered as having the greatest influence on the field of sustainability. We encouraged them to nominate women. We also asked the CSOs to help us determine the definition of a "Pioneer." Two categories of Pioneers emerged, chief executive officers and thought leaders.
    Only 12 percent of nominees were women: When we tallied the responses, five women and 37 men were nominated as sustainability pioneers, a ratio nearing 1:7, or 12 percent female. The nominees included Janine Benyus, founder and president of the Biomimicry Institute; Gro Harlem Brundtland , former prime minister of Norway and United Nations Special Envoy on Climate Change; Barbara Krumsiek , chair, president and CEO of Calvert Investments; Indra Nooyi , chairperson and CEO of  PepsiCo ; and Anita Roddick , founder of The Body Shop. 
    Let me start by saying that all five of these women are tremendous pioneers. In my opinion, they're on par with the six men in the Pioneers Report. However, relative to the number of men nominated for the Pioneers list, many fewer women received nominations. I believe this is where the root of the problem lies. 
    Gender-balanced voters voted for female pioneers only 16 percent of the time: Once we had a list of nominations, we asked several hundred sustainability professionals to vote for one Pioneer in each category: CEO and thought leader. Voters were split nearly equally by gender. In total, 35 women and 38 men voted for the final list of Pioneers. The vast majority of voters did not select female nominees. Just five of 35 women (14 percent) voted for a female pioneer. Only seven of 38 men (18 percent) voted for a woman. If anything, men were slightly more supportive of female pioneers.
    Reader feedback on the report
    Readers had the opportunity to comment on our report, and they did so in a variety of ways. They could disagree with the choices of Pioneers, or nominate their own favorite sustainability leaders. 
    Readers left comments on Marc Gunther's Guardian Sustainable Business articles about the report; others responded by Twitter or email. They mentioned more female pioneers, including Susie Tompkins Buell, Rachel Carson , Hannah Jones , Hunter Lovins, Safia Minney, Ana Maria Primavesi, Vandana Shiva  and Hazel Wolf.
    At the end of the day, though, most feedback came from female commenters who were disappointed that female pioneers had not been included in the report.
    Continuing the conversation
    Inspired by our report, Andrea Learned wrote an article, " Where are the Women Leaders in Sustainable Business ?" that appeared in the Guardian.
    Learned attributes the results of our report to the slow nature of cultural shifts. She writes that women have contributed to corporate social responsibility (CSR) from its early development as a field. But she believes that long-held perceptions in business and media about masculine versus feminine leadership qualities have impeded the recognition of women's contributions. She writes, "We can't see the greater evolution in business culture because we are in the middle of it. But, the footprints of women are already there." She describes three stages of sustainability leadership: Pioneers, Next Shifters and Future Shifters.
    Hazel Henderson, founder of Ethical Markets Media and a sustainability leader in her own right, recently expressed similar thoughts about women's current and future roles in sustainability. Her CSRwire blog post about the UN Global Compact's September Leadership Summit refers to a "new wave [of female visionaries], following pioneers of socially responsible business and investing. … Women are now seizing leadership, and the smartest men in the room are willing followers!"
    Three reasons for fewer nominations
    I have some hypotheses about why fewer women than men were nominated for the list: 
    1. The Pioneers in the report had integral and wide-sweeping impacts on business sustainability, often at the field's beginning.
    Epstein-Reeves and I believed that many nominated women belonged on the Pioneers list. However, their influence on the overall field of sustainability may have been more limited, or at least perceived as such by our survey respondents.
    For example, Benyus has made brilliant contributions to biomimicry, but corporate sustainability comprises a variety of other elements as well. Roddick, sadly, died in 2007 before she could finish implementing her groundbreaking visions for CSR. And although Brundtland has done an enormous amount at the global level, she is a less familiar figure in the United States. Most survey voters were American.
    2. The gender gap in corporate leadership indicates we still have far to go.
    The gender gap in business, particularly in corporate leadership, is troubling. It is even more evident at the highest levels of corporate leadership. Among this year's Fortune 500 companies, just 22 women were CEOs. The number has risen 65 percent over the last three years, but a long road lies ahead of us in closing the gap.
    When identifying CEOs and thought leaders who have made a long-term impact on sustainability, it makes sense to look at what individuals were doing 20 years ago. At that time, there were even fewer female CEOs than today. And thought leaders of that time likely found it difficult to get the same levels of access to corporate sustainability as men did.
    3. The Pioneers represent just a few of the many individuals who influenced sustainability and continue to today.
    Our report focused on six leading Pioneers. However, a vast field of talented and dedicated individuals have molded the history of sustainability. These professionals form a complex network of people who have influenced and inspired each other. We chose to profile a few notable contributors, with the understanding that our list shows just the cusp of the field.

    By Meghna Tare, Director of Sustainability at the University of Texas at Arlington
    A growing number of institutions of higher education are channeling their efforts towards sustainability. Because our economy and society are dependent on a healthy environment, sustainability requires balancing economic success with environmental conservation and social equity, also known as the triple bottom line.
    We have learned from experience that university campuses that tie together multiple areas of sustainability into a comprehensive, holistic plan or road map tend to be more successful — at getting buy-in from the community, funding various initiatives, and achieving results and recognition. UT Arlington joins a small group of leading universities worldwide that present their sustainability action plan based on the GRI Reporting Framework and its Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. Sustainability Reporting Framework enables us to measure and report our sustainability performance. By reporting transparently and with accountability, we can increase the trust that stakeholders and community have in us and achieve a competitive edge.
    Within the United States, UT Arlington is one of the three universities to publish a GRI report. The full report is available for download at our website.
    Sustainability Programs and Initiatives at UT Arlington
    The organic community garden at UT Arlington, which was built in cooperation with the City of Arlington on campus, has become a public green space for families, community members, and garden enthusiasts. The University’s award-winning composting program contributes compost to the gardens.
    The compost program annually composts 32.4 tons of food waste from on-campus dining services and off-campus coffee shops and hospitals as well as yard waste collected from campus ground crews.
    We have a stakeholder partnership with Air North Texas committed to educating the public about air quality, carpooling and public transit, maintaining vehicles to reduce emissions, walking and bicycling, and other clean air choices. We also have stakeholder relationships with City of Arlington, Chamber of Commerce, EPA Region 6, North Central Texas Council of Government ( NCTCOG ), etc. UTA is also a partner of the North Texas Municipal Sustainable Materials and Pollution Prevention Forum, a grant-funded effort dedicated to bringing together North Texas governmental and quasi-governmental organizations to share best practices, lessons learned and resources to ease the burden of developing and supporting sustainability and environmental initiatives.
    Since 1974, UT Arlington has had an aggressive energy conservation program dedicated to staying ahead of increasing fuel and utility costs and, in doing so, reducing financial impacts and responsibly managing public funds. In 2009 and 2011, the University completed two energy performance contracts that invested $27.9 million in building retrofits, system and equipment upgrades, and upgraded energy controls. The energy savings from these measures total over $3 million annually.
    The University has committed to pursuing LEED certification on future buildings. The U.S. Green Building Council has awarded LEED Gold certification to the College Park Center and the Engineering Research Building. This 234,000 square foot building features green and light-reflecting roofs, window designs for improved use of available light, a 28,000 gallon rain and condensate water capture and storage system for landscape irrigation, and 3.5 million kilowatt hours of renewable energy credits (RECs).
    The Green at College Park , a 2.6-acre park on the south side of College Park Center, was one of the first three projects to be certified through the Sustainable Sites Initiative. The Sustainable Sites Initiative ™ (SITES™) is an interdisciplinary effort by the American Society of Landscape Architects, the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at The University of Texas at Austin and the United States Botanic Garden to create voluntary national guidelines and performance benchmarks for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. This four-acre park features natural habitat, restorative landscape design and storm water retention ponds.
    The University’s car sharing program provides hourly car rentals to students, faculty, and staff. More than 750 individuals use car sharing on campus. We are exploring the possibility of offering a bike rental program on campus in 2014.
    The North Texas Commission awarded University of Texas at Arlington the 2012 Working for Clean Air Award for Best Community Impact and 2013 award for the Best University.
    Engaging students and faculty
    Today, most campus sustainability initiatives are comprised of cost savings from the use of long-lasting CFL bulbs or double-paned windows. But economic benefit is not the only force driving sustainability at UT Arlington. We tap into the “moral imperative,” based on the concept that everything is part of the puzzle. Our educational programs, comprehensive research and community service help to cultivate the holistic systems thinking that sustainability requires. As a member of American Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education ( AASHE ), we support and contribute to AASHE’s goal to “ help students understand the interaction between social, environmental, and economic forces, and to apply that understanding to real-world problems.”
    As a part of the University Sustainability Committee, the Curriculum, Research, and Community Engagement (CRCE) work group promotes sustainability as an intellectual focus in the University’s academic affairs and is dedicated to integrating sustainability themes across all academic disciplines such as architecture, business, liberal arts, science, and engineering. Key approaches include curriculum development and enhancement, faculty development, promotion of sustainability-related research, and community engagement. The group encourages faculty, students, and others in the University and beyond to develop a deeper understanding of sustainability issues and how they apply within various fields of study.
    Leading by example
    This summary of Transformations: Sustainability on Campus and Beyond, highlights the progress we are making through the individual and joint efforts of administration, faculty, staff, and students—and through partnerships with communities, businesses, government, and higher education. Students attending a university that places high value on sustainable operations are more likely to take this mindset to their future places of employment where they can help shape the future of environmentally-friendly companies. We hope that our leadership will serve as an example for other educational institutions.

    A look back at 2013's biggest sustainability themes in the US
    The rise of renewables, the Rana Plaza tragedy, corporate coalitions around sustainability, and getting inequality onto the agenda - 2013 was a busy year for sustainability
    Jump to comments (…)
    This fall, President Obama declared that inequality is the "defining challenge of our age." Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images
    It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future, the baseball player Yogi Berra reportedly said .  (Or was it the physicist Neils Bohr ? Or Hollywood mogul Samuel Goldwyn ?)
    Whoever said it, I agree - so instead of trying to forecast 2014, let's look back at the the big stories in sustainable business from 2013, knowing that they will shape whatever lies ahead. As the US editor-at-large of Guardian Sustainable Business , I'll offer what is unavoidably a US-centric perspective.
    Greenhouse gas emissions, in decline
    The carbon dioxide emissions that cause climate change have declined in five of the last seven years in the US, largely becase utilities are burning less coal and more natural gas and renewable energy.
    Last fall, the government reported that energy-related CO2 emissions had fallen by 3.8% in 2012, bringing them to their lowest level since 1994 and more than 12% below the peak year, 2007. A confluence of factors explains the drop. The fracking boom is generating cheap natural gas. Activist campaigns and pollution rule have made coal-burning less economical. Factories are more efficient, as are cars. As we know, the energy sector is capital intensive and famously slow to change. But these numbers show that it can change, and change dramatically.
    Solar power, mainstream at last
    Every four minutes, on average, a new solar power system is installed in the US. Most are small rooftop panels, to be sure, but they add up: the solar industry is on pace to install about 4,300 megawatts of electric capacity in 2013 (about as much as all the solar capacity between 2000 and 2011)  and the industry is growing by 40% a year. So excited are investors about solar's growth that they sent the stock of industry darling Solar City up by more than 500% since its initial public offering about a year ago. That said, solar power still delivers less than 0.5% of all US power generation.
    The aftermath of Rana Plaza
    Sadly, it can take a tragedy to awaken business to its responsibilities. The death of more than 1,100 people in the collapse of a factory at Rana Plaza outside Dhaka, Bangladesh, in April led to soul-searching in the garment industry and, so far, a couple of industry alliances focused on fire safety in Bangladash, the Accord on Fire and Building Safety signed by more than 100 apparel firms, most based in the EU, as well as global and Bangladeshi trade unions, and the and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety , composed mostly of big US retailers including Walmart, Gap and Target.
    The two groups have arrived at common standards, which will prevent some loss of life in the future in Bangladesh--no small thing. More important, companies in industries like apparel and electronics that profit handsomely from doing business in places with cheap labour and little regard for human rights are learning, at last, that they need to play a greater role in the costly, difficult and for the most part unrewarding work of helping those places protect their own people.
    Industrial-strenth sustainability
    The Bangaldesh coalitions are but one example of a heartening trend in corporate America - the willingness of companies to work with their competitors, as well as up and down their supply chains, to attack problems that are too big for any one firm to solve on its down.
    The Sustainable Apparel Coalition, a collection of retailers, brands, manufacturers and NGOs, has developed the Higg Index , an open-source tool to better measure the environmental and social impact of apparel and footwear. BSR's Human Rights Working Group brings tech companies, mining and oil companies and consumer products firms together to promote human rights. This isn't new--coalitions like the Marine Stewardship Council have been around since the late 1990s--but broader approaches to big problems are becoming the rule, not the exception.
    Inequality, on the political agenda
    This fall, President Obama declared that inequality is the "defining challenge of our age," populist Bill de Blasio was elected mayor of New York and signs that leftish Senator Elizabeth Warren had captured the soul of the Democratic Party was described as "Hilary's Nightmare" , before Warren took her name out of the 2016 presidential race.
    The numbers, as laid out by Obama, are stark: the top 10% of Americans take half of the national income and big-company CEOs now make 273 times that income of the average worker. Even more worrisome is the decline in social mobility; a child born into the bottom 20% has a less than 1-in-20 shot at making it to the top. The challenge for corporates will be to share the wealth they generate with their own workers, and seek creative ways to enhance opportunity for the poor. Starbucks was ahead of the curve with its Create Jobs for the USA . Others should follow. 
    The year ahead also will surely bring advances in such promising arenas as measuring natural capital , context-based sustainability and integrated reporting --the slow-moving but important ins and outs of the corporate sustainability movement. We'll likely get a decision on Keystone XL, more EPA rules for coal plants and ongoing controversy around GMOs. Never a dull moment!

  :title: Colleges And Universities Can't Cut Their Way to Sustainability - Forbes
  :text: |
    Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments
    The difficult reality at most institutions is that revenues aren’t keeping pace with costs. According to a recent Moody’s report , tuition revenue at about 4 in 10 institutions are growing below the rate of inflation. Another Moody’s report cited 7% revenue declines at community colleges between 2009 and 2010.
    Given these challenging economic conditions, many institutions are facing difficult decisions on where to make cuts. Because the majority of an institution’s expenses are for instructionally-related or academic support activities, most colleges and universities are taking a hard look at which academic programs they offer.
    The simple realization is that institutions simply cannot afford to offer all of the programs they used to and they must begin to prioritize which programs are more important than others.
    Prioritizing Programs
    Using a process developed by former University of Northern Colorado president, Robert C. Dickeson, most institutions are gathering data to evaluate each academic (and administrative) program or unit against ten criteria including: demand, quality, revenues and costs associated with the program, connection to mission, and an opportunity analysis.
    The process forces institutions to make tough decisions about which programs are worthy of future investment, which ones are doing well and should be maintained, and which programs are candidates for restructuring or closure.
    A National Trend
    The good news is that most institutions are taking the difficult steps to rein in costs and re-examine their offerings. Only a few years ago the percentage of institutions pursuing prioritization efforts was relatively small; that percentage has grown substantially in recent years.
    In March 2013, Academic Impressions surveyed 115 institutions of higher education, soliciting a quick, national snapshot of their efforts to prioritize academic and administrative programs. We found that:
    49% had undertaken a prioritization effort
    26% were planning to undertake one in the future
    Only a quarter of respondents hadn’t or weren’t planning on undertaking such an effort.
    Cost Cutting is Only Half the Battle
    It turns out that too many higher-ed institutions approach this process as primarily an exercise in cutting costs, and this approach both drives up resistance and blinds the institution to very real opportunities for strategic growth.
    Higher-ed leaders can’t just cut programs and services. To both respond to a time of economic slowdown and plan for future sustainability and growth, leaders need to identify those areas that truly differentiate their institutions.
    There are over 4,000 nonprofit higher-ed institutions in the US and thousands more for-profit institutions. To set their campuses apart in an increasingly crowded marketplace, institutions need to make active investments in new and existing programs, not just cut under-performing programs.
    Thriving in the Future
    Average tuition revenue is approximately 38% of a median family’s earnings—to ensure viable demand for their institutions, leaders will need to find ways to dramatically lower costs and pursue new sources of growth.
    This will take both the bravery and the will to ask the tough questions. As you can imagine, we also found that respondents cited a common array of obstacles to these efforts – fear of change, resistance from key constituents, and a lack of brave leadership.
    “Urgency is critical but not in our DNA,” one university leader noted. If institutions are to thrive in the years ahead, they need to frame the conversation as not only a cost-cutting exercise but rather an exercise in identifying needed areas of reinvestment and opportunities to differentiate the institution from numerous peers.
    In the end, institutions cannot cut their way to sustainability.

    Beyond Business Makes History with Three GRI G4 Reports
    Submitted by: Beyond Business
    Posted: Dec 19, 2013 – 03:27 PM EST
     
    TEL AVIV, Dec. 19 /CSRwire/ -  Beyond Business Ltd wishes to congratulate three clients in three sectors and on three continents – GSK Romania , Caesars Entertainment Corporation and ECI Telecom – on the publication of Sustainability Reports in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 CORE level sustainability reporting guidelines.
    All three companies published GRI G4 CORE level reports in December 2013, and all three reports represent "firsts" in their respective sectors and geographies, including the first report in the world to be approved by GRI using the Materiality Matters check. This makes the month of December 2013 a historic month for sustainability reporting, advancing the uptake of the G4 guidelines and leading the way in accountable and transparent business practice and communications.
    Cohen says: "We would like to congratulate GSK Romania , Caesars Entertainment Corporation and ECI Telecom on their sustainability achievements and reporting leadership. We are proud to be the only sustainability reporting consulting firm in the world, I believe, to have been involved in the development of three published G4 CORE level reports, including the first G4 report in the world to pass the GRI G4 Materiality Matters check."
    GSK Romania: GSK Romania is a wholly owned subsidiary of GSK plc., and one of the largest and most diverse pharmaceutical companies in Romania, focused on creating value by helping Romanians extend their life expectancy. GSK Romania's second annual CSR Report, "Valuing your Trust," meets G4 Core requirements and is structured in line with parent company GSK's approach to reporting. This is the first G4 report published in Romania. The process involved a local stakeholder panel to discuss material issues. Please visit  www.gsk.ro .
    Caesars Entertainment: Caesars Entertainment Corporation is the world's most diversified casino-entertainment company and operates primarily under the Caesars®, Harrah's® and Horseshoe® brand names. Caesars also owns London Clubs International. Caesars Entertainment's fourth annual CSR and Sustainability Report, "Vibrant Communities," demonstrates leading practice in the gaming-entertainment industry and is the first report in the world to be published after having received approval from the GRI through the Materiality Matters check, which confirms the inclusion of material disclosures in the report. Please visit www.caesars.com .
    ECI Telecom: Founded in 1961, ECI provides scalable broadband access, transport and data networking infrastructure that provides the foundation for the communications of tomorrow, including next-generation voice, IPTV, mobility and other business solutions. This is the second full Sustainability Report of ECI Telecom, headquartered in Israel, and is called "Advancing Sustainable Connectivity." It is the first G4 to be published from an Israeli company, and the first G4 report in the world from a company in the telecommunications sector. Please visit www.ecitele.com .
    Gwen Migita, VP Sustainability & Community Affairs, Caesars Entertainment Corp, says:
    "It was important for Caesars Entertainment to demonstrate our work in the sustainability space. Our report, titled ‘Vibrant Communities’ tells the story of how Caesars Entertainment continues to make positive economic, social and environmental contributions.”
    Eynat Rotfeld, CSR and Employee Engagement Manager, ECI Telecom, says:
    “Sustainability is central to our operations, from recycling and waste management to energy savings and empowering our employees to volunteer. As a telecom solution provider, we have an even more significant role in this space as our solutions promote what we call sustainable connectivity, bringing e-health, e-education and other advanced services to many communities in the world. Beyond Business helped us report all of our efforts in one standardized and internationally recognized framework.”

    New Haven >> Yale’s School of Management is expanding its academic program to go along with its bigger physical presence on campus.
    The school, currently putting the finishing touches on its new Edward P. Evans Hall on Whitney Avenue, announced that it will add more specialties to its executive MBA program.
    “There is a lot of momentum now,” said David Bach, senior associate dean for EMBA and global programs. “We want to take advantage of that and broaden the impact we have.”
    Yale’s executive MBA program offers a concentration in one particular aspect of management, along with the core curriculum that all Yale MBA students take. The program started in 2005 with an emphasis on health care.
    Bach said the two new topics reflect larger societal values that increasingly intersect with business decisions.
    “Sustainability is no longer something a small number of companies worry about,” Bach said. “At the same time, we have a lot of expertise here and resources outside of the business school that we can draw upon.”
    That includes resources at Yale’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Paul Anastas, a chemistry professor who teaches at FES , will be faculty director for the sustainability concentration.
    “For half a century we have dealt with traditional sustainability issues — resource availability, energy, climate change — by thinking about what you cannot do, or what you have to reduce or eliminate,” Anastas said in a statement released by the management school.
    “There has been a transformation to thinking about what you can create, invent and innovate by aligning sustainability issues with economic drivers and market forces,” Anastas said.
    Likewise, the executive MBA program’s asset management concentration aims to look at investing in a wider framework.
    “Finance underpins a lot of the things we value in our society, including charity, higher education and the ability to retire,” Bach said. “That is made possible by asset management, and Yale has a track record in this. How do you manage endowments? How do you manage pension plans? There are faculty members in the forefront of research in this.”
    The new concentrations begin next fall. Bach said the entire program will have 60 students, with 30 focusing on health care, 15 studying asset management and 15 studying sustainability.
    The two-year program is geared toward people already in the workforce and will be conducted primarily on weekends.
    “It’s very carefully scheduled,” Bach said. “They don’t have to quit their jobs to do this. What they learn on Friday and Saturday in class, they apply in their jobs on Monday.”

  :title: Sustainability Ratings Standard Moves Forward - Environmental Leader
  :text: |
    Water Management
    The Global Initiative for Sustainability Ratings (GISR) has released the 12 core principles it will use for accrediting sustainability ratings worldwide.
    The GISR standard will comprise three components: principles, issues and indicators. The principles identify the core attributes of a ratings framework applicable to all sustainability ratings, rankings and indices. Issues are themes, topics or aspects of sustainability material used to assess a company’s sustainability performance, such as water stewardship and carbon emissions .
    The 12 principles are: transparency, impartiality, continuous improvement, inclusiveness, assurability, materiality, comprehensiveness, sustainability context, long-term horizon, value chain, balance and comparability.
    GISR says the year-long effort included participation from leaders in the investment and corporate communities including Aviva, Deutsche Bank, Bloomberg, BBVA, TIAA-CREF and UBS, which are members of GISR’s core committees; and AMD, UPS, Vale, Disney, Bosch and Bayer, which are members of GISR’s technical working group.
    Launched by Ceres and the Tellus Institute in 2011 , GISR is a global nonprofit initiative that aims to accelerate the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues and indicators into global financial markets and investment decision-making. GISR will not rate companies on sustainability measures, but will instead accredit sustainability ratings, rankings or indices that meet certain standards of excellence for assessing corporate sustainability performance.
    Currently, more than 100 rating systems are evaluating various aspects of the ESG performance of more than 10,000 companies using more than 400 issues and 2,000 indicators.  In collaboration with the sustainability ratings community, NGOs, investors and companies, GISR aims to further harmonize and expand the global market for high quality sustainability ratings, rankings and indices.

    By Jo Blakemore ,
    North East housebuilder Miller Homes has outlined ambitions to create a more sustainable business with the launch of its new sustainability strategy
    A North East housebuilder has outlined ambitions to create a more sustainable business with the launch of its new sustainability strategy, A Better Place.
    Miller Homes’ strategy, which has been developed after in-depth research into the needs and concerns of stakeholders, sets out in detail the developer’s aims and objectives between now and 2020.
    Chief executive Chris Endsor said: “To us, being sustainable means playing a full part in working to safeguard the long-term future of the world around us by ensuring we do all we can to preserve the physical environment, create communities that flourish and build quality homes for generations to come.
    “Sustainable development has been an integral part of our overall business strategy for a number of years as we recognise the direct and indirect benefits to both our customers and our business, and we are continually looking for ways to evolve and enhance our approach. A Better Place has been developed to focus on the issues that matter most to us and our stakeholders and it shapes the way we will approach every aspect of our work over the next seven years.”
    The research carried out by the builder incorporated feedback from stakeholders, including customers, employees, supply chain, shareholders, trade and professional bodies, non-governmental organisations, government and its agencies.
    It helped identify 18 key issues, ranging from customer satisfaction and community wellbeing to waste and economy, employment and education to ecology and biodiversity. Delivery of A Better Place will be undertaken by teams across Miller Homes through short, medium and long-term targets which will be measured against key performance indicators.
    Endsor added: “We are fully committed to our new strategy and it will be delivered through the combined efforts of all our employees, contractors and suppliers at every level of our business, who we know from the research we have undertaken have a real desire to be involved and we are keen to harness that enthusiasm.
    “We will report annually on our progress and will also continue to review and update our approach to ensure it remains relevant in the future.”
    Miller Homes has nine developments across the North East, including Wensleydale Park in Blyth, Wheatlands Chase in Redcar and St Mary’s Green in Acklam, as well as Greenvale Park in Newcastle, Bishops Park and Park View in Gateshead, The Meadows in Framwellgate Moor, Mariner’s Way in Seaham and Kingsmoor in Stockton.

    SINGAPORE -- From the moment you step off the plane at Changi International Airport, this Southeast Asian island city-state reveals its penchant for being green. In stunning contrast to most airports around the world, Changi’s park-like passenger terminals incorporate lush gardens of cactus, palms, orchids and ferns growing under natural light. 
    Beyond the airport, the boulevard leading downtown is lined by miles of flowering plants and a canopy of carefully pruned rain trees -- a theme that continues throughout the island. 
     
    If you’re looking for the Singapore of old -- the seedy port immortalized in movies such as 1940’s "The Letter," in which Bette Davis plays a wealthy murderer betrayed by a mysterious woman from the city’s gloomy Chinese quarter -- you’re out of luck. Singapore is now more Beverly Hills than Bangkok.
     
    The image of Singapore as a dark, dirty and dangerous place was accurate as recently as the 1960s, when the former British colony off the Malay Peninsula was decidedly a developing nation. Even now, it has its share of problems: Tensions revolving around living and working conditions for the nearly one million migrant workers and a government with a tendency toward the totalitarian, which levies huge fines for minor offenses such as jaywalking or littering and still imposes the violent criminal punishment of caning for more serious crimes. The message is clearly reinforced on the passenger declaration forms handed out on international flights, which warn that anyone who enters the country with illegal drugs is subject to death, whatever their nationality. 
     
    So there is that.
     
    Yet Singapore is a stunning success story in many ways, and one of the more obvious is its strong commitment to all things green. Environmental sustainability is seen as a way not only to improve the quality of life but also to lure international business and, in a very real sense, to survive.
     
    During the past two decades, the Singaporean city-state has built upon outside investment and its strategically located port to ascend into the upper echelon of the developed world, and is now one of the busiest shipping hubs and wealthiest nations on earth, per capita. In terms of GDP per capita, Singapore ranks third worldwide, at just over $60,000, after Qatar ($102,000) and Luxembourg ($79,000); the U.S., by comparison, ranks seventh, with a GDP per capita of around $50,000. In terms of the volume of traffic through Singapore's port, it was recently surpassed by Shanghai and is essentially tied with Rotterdam for the No. 2 slot. An estimated 140,000 vessels pass through Singapore's deepwater port annually.
     
    Singapore is also fast becoming a global model for sustainability -- a clean, green “city of the future,” as the handouts proclaimed during a recent government-sponsored media tour that included journalists from the United States, China and India, including the International Business Times. Though a measure of skepticism is in order considering that the government paid our way, there's no arguing the fact that Singapore is one of the most physically and philosophically green urban areas on earth. 
     
    In terms of environmentally sustainable and green cities worldwide, “Singapore is probably No. 1,” observed Kathryn Gustafson, director of the landscape consulting firm Gustafson Porter USA, which designed part of Singapore's iconic horticultural theme park known as Gardens by the Bay. “The government gives priority of landscape green in front of everything else. I have never seen a parks department with so much power.”

    The commitment to green is not only about aesthetics. Singapore, with its intensively developed land mass roughly equal in size to New York City’s, is also actively engaged in an array of conservation, recycling and reclamation measures, striving for environmental sustainability because of -- not despite -- its lack of natural resources and dense population (only fellow city-state Monaco’s population is denser). 
     
    It is a pragmatic approach toward conservation, observed Khoo Teng Chye, director of Singapore's Centre for Liveable Cities. “There have been suggestions that only wealthy cities can be green and environmentally sustainable," Chye said. "I think for Singapore, it is the other way round. Singapore is doing well economically because it is environmentally conscious. This consciousness is very much in policy making, land use planning and community engagement, and is essential for Singapore to be a liveable city and sustainable economy.”
     
    More than 7,000 multinational corporations are based in Singapore, and the government recognizes that to support those businesses and attract new ones requires more than parks, greenery and high quality of life. Most large companies need low energy costs and ready solutions to environmental challenges, both of which are the focus of business organizations such as the Singapore Sustainability Alliance, a collaboration of government agencies, industry representatives, NGOs and academic institutions that works with existing companies and new prospects to capitalize on its sustainability programs and to help with the adoption of sustainable practices. The alliance’s business-development programs include sustainable manufacturing practices, sustainable water use, waste management and recycling, and energy efficiency. 
     
    Meanwhile, to ensure Singapore’s growth as a communications technology hub, the National Environment Agency partners with new and existing businesses such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and International Business Machines Corp., which have built manufacturing and data storage facilities, both of which needed a way to reduce high energy costs associated with the tropical climate. Toward that aim, the government partnered with H-P to develop a new set of energy-efficiency benchmarks that reduced electric use and provided a template for other businesses -- a crucial measure considering that Singapore still relies largely on imported sources for energy production. 
     
    Singapore also offers assistance to businesses that specialize in clean technology through the Cleantech division of its Economic Development Board. The board's director, Goh Chee Kiong, said that business sector experienced “continued robust growth” this year in the areas of renewable energy, energy efficiency, smart grids, green buildings, electric mobility and water conservation. 
     
    New investments in energy management announced in 2013 include the Asian Centre of Excellence, which specializes in developing smart grids and renewable energy; Hanergy, a China company that is one of the world’s largest thin-film solar producers, which established its international headquarters in Singapore; the German company Saferay, which built a global solar project development center; and DHI, a Danish water and environment research and technology consultancy, which announced plans to expand it Asia-Pacific R&D and engineering center in Singapore.
     
    The vision for a green city-state began under former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the outspoken and dogmatic “father” of modern Singapore, who was in office for three decades and now serves in the position of minister-mentor. In 1965, two years after Singapore gained independence from Britain and, a short time later, Malaysia, Yew announced his intention to use greenery to differentiate the vulnerable and largely poor city-state from other Asian countries, in hopes of attracting international investment and tourists as well as to soften the harsh realities of urban life. Among the first to go were the crowded slums, houseboats and pig corrals along the Singapore River, now the site of pedestrian promenades and gleaming skyscrapers.
     
    Yew’s vision paid off and has become increasing entrenched as Singapore’s population has more than doubled since the 1980s to 5.4 million and with increasing international competition for investment. Remarkably, during the population and building boom, the land area of Singapore with “green cover” grew from about 35 percent to about 46 percent, according to Wong Chock Fang, assistant director at the Centre for Liveable Cities. As evidence of how well established the green initiative has become, Singapore recently changed its public-relations moniker from “Garden City” to “City in a Garden” -- a subtle distinction meant to convey that its greenery is no longer a mere adornment. 
     
    The impact of the greenery is visually magnified by carefully designed landscape corridors, and about 10 percent of Singapore’s land is protected in some way, including four comparatively large biodiversity reserves. Because Singapore has run out of land and the only way to grow is either up or down, almost all new construction is high-rise or subterranean and designed with environmental sensitivity in mind, including the use of “sky-rise greenery” in the form of vegetated walls and roofs that help improve air quality, lower building cooling costs and add to the overall aesthetics and quality of life. Based on German prototypes, green walls and roofs are a natural idea in Singapore’s tropical environment, where mosses, ferns, philodendrons, orchids and other epiphytes literally grow on trees. 
     
    Alan Tan, director of Singapore’s Uniseal Creative Solutions, which designs green architectural installations, said the initial push for vegetative construction came in 2006, when it was seen as a way to beautify buildings. Green installations, whether interior or exterior, quickly took off, and on exterior facades, are easy to maintain, he said, adding, “Nothing is maintenance free -- I get my hair cut every month.” Green walls and roofs are expensive to install -- about SGD $600 (around USD $475) per square meter, though lower cost alternatives are available that rely on cheaper materials and container pots of unirrigated plants, Tan said. So far, 64,000 square meters of green roofs have been installed in Singapore, he said.

    The green approach encompasses programs and pilot projects involving intensive water, sewage and solid waste recycling, electric mass transit, passive lighting and irrigation systems, and -- though Singapore still lags behind the rest of the world in renewable energy -- solar power, tidal turbines and, a bit ominously, the possible use of floating micro-nuclear plants manufactured in Russia. Part of the electricity at Gardens by the Bay is supplied by a generator powered by the incineration of horticultural waste. 
     
    Much of what a visitor sees is more naturalized than natural -- highly cultivated, clearly of manmade design, often with special lighting or other artificial effects. As architect Liu Thai-Ker, who is chairman of the Centre for Liveable Cities and was this year’s keynote speaker at the Green Space Asia symposium in Singapore, observed, “We have a rich British legacy, a green heritage, but it’s not jungley.” Outside of a few preserves -- and sometimes within them, nature tends to be heavily pruned and carefully landscaped, the product of design. Tan likewise noted that many of his clients associate biodiverse plantings on green roofs and walls with ants, and opt for more manicured installations. 
     
    The natural world, in fact, is a distant memory in urbanized Singapore. The island’s original rainforests were largely cleared in the early 19th century for agriculture, leaving only about three percent in their current pristine state, with the vast majority of the land intensively developed. 
     
    But beginning in the mid-60s, under Yew’s administration, more than a million trees and shrubs were planted, along with untold vines and flowers, to soften what would otherwise have been harsh urban infrastructure. On the 150th anniversary of Singapore’s Botanic Gardens, in 2009, Yew, now 90, said he originally saw cultivation of the landscape as a way “to show investors that this was a well-organized place.” This summer, to mark 50 years since the start of Singapore’s greening efforts, he planted a rain tree at a public park. 
     
    Yew, who is either loved or reviled for his imperial approach to government, told the New York Times in 2007 that Singapore’s success was all along improbable: “It should not exist … We haven’t got the base, the space, the wherewithal.” Singapore’s striving to become autonomous -- which undergirds its green efforts -- is based on the fact that Singapore is a small island with few resources, vulnerable not only to climate change but also to the political and economic changes that will inevitably result. Along those lines, Yew noted that the Singaporean government was in consultation with Holland about building dikes to reduce expected damage from sea-level rises. 
     
    If environmental sustainability is a way to defend against current and future threats, it has also been a boon to investment and tourism. The centerpiece of Singapore’s green tourism effort is the Gardens by the Bay, built on reclaimed land, which mixes lush tropical plantings with manmade attractions such as 18 towering “supertrees” -- steel monoliths shrouded in vertical gardens of flowering plants and lighted for dramatic effect at night. The monoliths, meant to evoke rainforests, look more like Las Vegas or Dubai, particularly given the absurdist architectural towers of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel towering nearby, yet they, along with the park’s massive, domed greenhouses, themed gardens, landscaped outdoor performance venue and educational displays, make their point: Singapore has hitched its wagon to all things green.
     
    The Gardens by the Bay is also intended to be environmentally self-sustaining, which might seem a bit of stretch given such installations as the lighted supertrees and massive, air-conditioned greenhouses for temperate-forest and floral plantings. But as a guide on the recent media tour was quick to point out, there's that generator burning horticultural clippings from Singapore’s landscape maintenance program, and basins contained in the canopies of the supertrees collect rainwater for passive irrigation. 
     
    Also: J.Lo played there.
     
    Singapore's Gardens by the Bay eco-park includes massive greenhouses used for temperate-climate horticultural displays.  Alan Huffman
     
    Elsewhere on the site, “heritage gardens” pay tribute to Singapore’s multicultural history through Malay village plantings, Indian flowers and gardens interpreting Chinese philosophy and colonial style. And not far away is the prosaically named HortPark, with 20 more botanical gardens, including some developed specifically for rooftops and parking lots. Elsewhere across the island are 300 parks linked by landscaped roadside greenery; the oldest one, the Botanic Gardens, includes more than 10,000 kinds of trees and plants. 
     
    Singapore is also incorporating conventional conservation measures such as motion-activated lighting and escalators, household and commercial recycling and electric public transit, alongside innovative ideas such as restoring manmade canals to meandering streams and consolidating utility conduits, sewer and water lines and pneumatic garbage conveyors inside a network of underground tunnels. Recycling, though much-touted, remains a work in progress: 57 percent of Singapore’s solid waste is recycled and the remainder incinerated, with the ash -- which can be toxic -- deposited on a manmade offshore island surrounded by manmade mangrove swamps.
     
    Water -- specifically, fresh water -- represents an abiding challenge for Singapore despite abundant rainfall, due to its large population relative to the land available. Nearly half of its water is piped in from Malaysia through agreements set to expire in mid-century. The government is attempting to become autonomous through retention reservoirs, desalination plants and the reclamation of sewer water, marketed as NeWater, mostly for nonpotable purposes. An estimated 70 percent of Singapore’s sewage is recycled, and the remainder is retreated and discharged into the sea. 
     
    The efforts are guided by a 2002 master plan for environmental sustainability, the application of which continues to evolve. Fang, the assistant director at the Centre for Liveable Cities, noted that Singapore was seriously polluted a half-century ago and is still testing new ideas about sustainability. “We like to think of Singapore as a living laboratory,” she said.
     
    In some cases, the results of the experiment won't be known for 50 years or more, and in the meantime many challenges remain. Singapore’s migrant workers, for example, often live in squalid conditions that are anything but green; its wide boulevards offer comparatively few pedestrian crossings -- a particular problem given that jaywalking is illegal; and public buildings are uniformly over-air-conditioned. Even ever-expanding Changi airport, with its environmentally friendly park areas and conservation programs, is directly dependent upon booming air travel -- a major culprit when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. 
     
    Singapore meanwhile continues to import sand and rock from Malaysia to reclaim land from its shallow coastal waters, though there's recognition that the filling has taken an environmental toll on wetland habitats and coral reefs. In some reclaimed areas the government has recreated mangrove swamps, and it has established a coral nursery to help mitigate the loss of 60 percent of the original reefs. It has also cleaned up the once-fetid Singapore River, and increasingly includes green components in the construction of public housing, in which 80 percent of Singaporeans live (90 percent of whom “own” their apartments through 99-year leases). Clusters of high-rise apartments -- known as “towns” -- usually include parks, supermarkets and, in some cases, communal gardening areas, food being another challenge that Singapore hasn't yet overcome. Nearly all of the food is imported, with only an estimated 250 acres on the island remaining in farmland. When possible, the high-rise towns are built to catch breezes, with windows facing north and south to minimize heat from the eastern and western axis of the equatorial sun. 
     
    The government of Singapore hopes its development of sustainable technologies will find a lucrative export market as global populations becoming increasingly urban, and the country has developed what it purports to be the first urban biodiversity index for evaluating conservation efforts. It is also advising other countries about environmentally sustainable practices, including China, India, Myanmar and Sri Lanka, and plans to showcase its greenness when it hosts the World Cities Summit next year.
     
    The abiding goal, as Yew explained in a speech he gave three years after independence, is to build upon adversity, and to anticipate and deal with whatever threatens.
     
    “We have built,” he said. “We have progressed. But there is no hallmark of success more distinctive and more meaningful than achieving our position as the cleanest and greenest city in South Asia.”

    Why have academics been so slow to work with students on sustainability?
    Simon Kemp asks what is preventing academics and students going green together given the obvious wins when they do
    Jump to comments (…)
    Is a perceived lack of credibility in working with students to blame for the lag in sustainability partnerships? Photograph: Alamy
    Earlier this year the National Union of Students (NUS) awarded 25 student unions a share of £5m over two years through the Hefce funded Students' Green Fund to develop high impact sustainability projects for the benefit of local communities and students themselves.
    Student unions were only able to win this funding if they were able to demonstrate a strong partnership with their university in their sustainability projects. The Students' Green Fund engages more than 50,000 students which is great, but arguably the greatest potential long-term benefit from the scheme lies in the development of mutually beneficial partnerships between students and academics in sustainability – and beyond.
    Students significantly outnumber staff members in all higher education institutions (HEIs), with variability between the different types of universities, for example, research intensive compared to teaching led. As a result, there is a general acceptance that no institution can claim to be a truly sustainable university addressing social, economic, and environmental impacts without the engagement and active participation of the student body.
    Yet, until fairly recently, the typical model has been that universities and the academic staff have pursued their own sustainability research, teaching and operational work, while the students have run their own sustainability campaigns in the unions and affiliated societies.
    The higher education sector is awash with wonderful examples of academics freely collaborating in and across institutions on high-impact multidisciplinary sustainability projects. Similar stories can be told of businesses and academics working in partnership on sustainability solutions. These types of collaborations have been taking place for decades.
    The question is, why have academics and students been so slow to engage in meaningful sustainability partnerships? Is it because academics have been wary of a lack of perceived credibility in working with students rather than with other academics? Is it because the financial rewards from traditional funded research collaborations are clearer, an issue that might be partially redressed through the Students' Green Fund? The higher education landscape is shifting and sustainability might be one of the beneficiaries.
    The benefits to academics and universities from working with students on sustainability matters are clear. A recent Higher Education Academy report shows that over a three year period (pre and post tuition fees rises) more than 80% of students consistently believe sustainable development should be actively promoted and incorporated by UK universities. In a higher education world where student satisfaction is paramount, this is an area where partnerships can and do flourish – but how?
    The key to academics working with students is having clear benefits for all parties. Sustainability projects can be designed so that students contribute to data collection on a scale that is not possible by lone academics or small research teams. Firstly, the students can gain experience of data collection and training that can enhance their CVs, while improving their sustainability literacy. The combined data set can then be used as part of a solution to a sustainability problem, benefiting the university and/or the local community. Finally, the data and outcomes can be incorporated as part of a wider evidence base that might lead to future research outputs.
    One example of the application of this type of approach is the Blackout programme that we run at the University of Southampton. Through this annual event we manage to switch off all non-essential electrical equipment across a whole university on one night. This enormous and logistically challenging process involves accessing every office and common area in every building in the university, recording the equipment, and switching off the non-essential equipment to record the energy use savings. All within a two to three hour period.
    A project such as this cannot be achieved solely by academics as they would not be able to complete the enormous task over one evening. It is also impossible from a purely student perspective as it is necessary to have staff with students at all times when entering closed academic buildings, and especially offices.
    There are many other examples of excellent staff-student collaboration in universities and unions such as the work of Keele, Bristol, Worcester, Bradford, Canterbury Christ Church, to name but a few. However, the majority of sustainability work in higher education is still dominated by traditional models.
    The future of sustainability in our sector depends upon collaboration. Not in the traditional sense of academics collaborating with other academics, but academics collaborating with students. But is the academic community really ready for this shift?

    Walmart, Cargill and BIO discuss ‘sustainability’ at Ohio Grain Farmers Symposium

    COLUMBUS — Everyone has their own definition, but is seems today that everyone has a definition. That is one thing that can be said about the buzzword of the past decade: “Sustainability.”
    During the Ohio Grain Farmers Symposium Dec. 17 at the 4-H Center in Columbus, three farm and food companies made their best effort at explaining what this word means for their business, and their customers.

    The panel consisted of Jody Longshore, director of corporate responsibility for Cargill, Mark Eastham, manager of sustainability for Walmart’s Food Business, and James Eichhorst, director of state government relations for the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) .
    Eastham said Walmart tries to provide products that are sustainable for the environment and for people. But there are a couple limiting factors.
    Fast pace
    For one — people who shop at Wal-Mart often are in a hurry.
    “When customers come into Walmart and they see all the products on our shelves … they don’t have very much time to make a choice based on sustainability,” he said.
    A typical mother shopping at Wal-Mart may only spend five seconds before she’s made her decision and is moving on, Eastham said.
    Another factor is the limited involvement the store has with its products — functioning primarily as a retail store of goods that someone else produces. Eastham said about 80 percent of the environmental impact of the products comes from the suppliers — not the store — although the store tries to work with suppliers to help support sustainability efforts.
    Business sense
    Eastham said sustainability makes good business sense for Walmart, because it helps the company reduce energy use, and operating costs, so it can increase its outputs. The company is billed as the world’s largest retailer with 10,000 retail units, and employs 2.2 million people.
    Cargill, while certainly a smaller company, is a major international supplier of food, agriculture, financial and industrial products and services. Cargill employs 142,000 people across these fields, in 67 countries.
    Longshore said Cargill defines sustainability with profit in mind.
    “It’s really about growing more, more efficiently” he said. “We want to produce the biggest yields possible, doing it as efficiently as possible.”
    He said the company works to help farmers be more efficient — sometimes using less product — or using more product but with less waste.
    Considering consequences
    A big consideration, he said, is that “sustainability” needs to be something that works, and that doesn’t cause unintended consequences.
    “We don’t want to put something in place that’s going to (hinder) inputs and outputs,” he said.
    The Biotechnology Industry Organization is an advocacy trade organization for “biotechnology,” or “technology based on science.” Those technologies include healthcare, agriculture, industry and environment.
    Eichhorst, the company’s director of state government relations, did not mince words when he explained how important “profitability” is to being sustainable.
    “If you’re not profitable, you’re not in business; if you’re not in business, you’re not sustainable,” he said.
    Different views
    Dale Minyo, the agriculture broadcaster who moderated the forum, said it’s important to be aware of other people’s definitions of sustainability, so producers can “understand what other people are thinking.”
    The U.S. Department of Agriculture, for example, includes environmental and social concerns, as well as nutrition needs in its definition — alongside the obvious economic and profit interests.
    Eastham, in his closing comments, said Wal-Mart wants to tell farmers’ story.
    “We need to work with you all to tell the story — the appropriate story — and the best story, and the story that makes the most sense and is (in) the truest form,” he said.
    The company wants farmers to be efficient, and to sell their products 50-100 years into the future
    “Walmart is not ever going to attempt to prescribe any methods to you all, because you all know how to produce what you produce the best way that you can,” he said. “We really want to support you all in producing the most efficiently that we can.”

  :title: Four Sustainability Reporting Highlights of 2013 - Triple Pundit
  :text: |
    Ed note: Want to learn more about sustainability reporting? Consider an upcoming course on the Global Reporting Initiative’s new standards.
    By Matthew L. Mattila, J.D.
    2013 should be remembered as a transformative year for sustainability.  Significant developments emerged not just from sustainability reports, but from non-profits and regulators concerned with stakeholder interests and reporting standards.  Discussed below, are noteworthy events that suggest a trend toward mandatory reporting.
    1. GRI’s New G4 Standard
    First, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) published its new G4 standard .  As the international non-profit behind the most widely used sustainability reporting framework, GRI’s historical challenge has been to establish a cadre of dedicated reporters across diverse industries.  With voluntary reporting now in vogue, G4 promotes substance over form through an increased emphasis on materiality and giving stakeholders the information they need.
    Gone are the days of reporting on irrelevant matters to achieve the “A+” application level for reports.  Now, a sustainability report prepared “in accordance” with the GRI standard should be lean and green – the product of a stakeholder engagement process geared toward identifying material issues that must be addressed in the report. G4 increases the focus on disclosing why certain aspects are material, adding transparency to the process.  Moreover, when an organization lacks information to report on material items, it now must report on the timeline and necessary actions for resolving data gaps.  In short, the G4 emphasizes materiality and promotes accountability, making it an important development for 2013.
    2. SASB Standards
    Next, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) began the roll-out of its own sustainability reporting program after achieving accreditation by the American National Standards Institute.  SASB, a U.S. non-profit, aims to develop a comprehensive set of disclosure standards for public companies filing their Form 10-K annual reports and other required materials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Unlike the G4 standard, SASB offers an industry-specific standard for material disclosures.  While G4 reveals different issues material to each organization through an individualized stakeholder engagement process, SASB identifies common industry reporting criteria through evidence-based research, feedback from industry working groups, and public comment periods.
    SASB issued its first set of standards in 2013, focusing on the health care sector.  Standards for nine additional sectors (and a total of 88 industries) are expected to be issued over the next two years.  SASB standards help U.S. public companies comply with existing regulation, Regulation S-K, to disclose all material issues in the Form 10-K. After SASB completed standards for 88 industries in 2015, the SEC will have the choice to enforce SASB standards. Until this time, SASB is encouraging public companies to voluntarily adopt the standards.
    3. SEC declines “no-action” requests over shareholder proposals
    For its part, the SEC made its own strides in sustainability this year.  The agency disagreed with several no-action requests filed by public companies that sought to exclude sustainability-related shareholder proposals from their proxy statements.  Companies argued that climate change proposals were already “substantially implemented” through their sustainability reports and participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project.  The SEC routinely disagreed, since matters addressed in voluntary disclosures did not compare “favorably” with the shareholder proposals.
    Most visible perhaps, was the SEC’s response to a no-action request from PNC Financial Services Group, where shareholders requested that PNC assess greenhouse gas emissions from its lending portfolio.  The company sought to exclude the proposal because it dealt with matters relating to ordinary day-to-day business.  The SEC disagreed with PNC’s request, noting “the proposal focuses on the significant policy issue of climate change.”  This reflects a departure from recent prior decisions by the SEC and a subtle nod to the Agency’s 2010 climate change guidance, likely triggering a renewed focus on substantive climate change disclosures in future 10-Ks.
    4. EPA amendments to GHG reporting program
    Finally, at a time when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is facing multiple challenges to its authority to regulate greenhouse gases (GHGs), the agency updated and strengthened its GHG reporting rule.  Since 2009, the rule has required reports for certain facilities that generate more than a threshold annual amount of GHGs.  The November 2013 amendments update the global warming potentials that entities must use to report, keeping in step with the Fourth Assessment Report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The amendments ensure improved reporting accuracy and that data is compatible with the United States’ own international GHG reporting obligations.  EPA acknowledged that more facilities will now be required to report as a consequence of the amendments.
    The above illustrates just a few sustainability reporting highlights for 2013, but they suggest a trend toward mandatory sustainability reporting.  Based on the new G4 standard and SASB standards, there is an increased emphasis on providing investors and other stakeholders with material sustainability information.  SASB clearly seeks to articulate standards that will be used for required financial reporting, and the SEC appears responsive based on policy trends that bolster the need for climate change analysis and disclosures by public companies.  Meanwhile, these trends are consistent with EPA’s decision to update its GHG reporting rule.  Although that rule reflects a small portion of sustainability-related disclosures and applies only to certain facilities (as opposed to an entire organization), EPA’s amendments show that GHG reporting requirements are here for the long-term.  Given the events of 2013, sustainability reporting is evolving from mainstream to mainstay for many companies.

    Sustainability advocates unite
    BY LILY ABROMEIT | DECEMBER 09, 2013 5:00 AM
    Achieving a more sustainable campus has been an underlying goal at the University of Iowa for years, and University of Iowa Student Government senators took another step in an environmentally friendly direction Sunday with a Sustainability Summit.
    Hosted by UISG, the summit was aimed at opening up discussion among UI officials, students, and community members as well as state leaders.
    “It’s a great chance to showcase all the things the UI is doing [and] it’s also good to transition the university from providing [not only] education, but also advocacy,” said Jeffrey Ding, UISG’s sustainability liaison.
    Sen. Rob Hogg, D-Cedar Rapids, who delivered one of two keynote speakers, said he hoped the event would encourage students to become more informed and active.
    “I hope they make a commitment … and decide to commit their lives to the fight for sustainability,” he said.
    Liz Christiansen, the director of the UI Office of Sustainability, said the university is on track for the 2020 sustainability goal, which was helped largely in fiscal 2013 by a 70 percent increase in recycling in UI Housing and Dining and a 43 percent increase on both the main campus and UI Hospitals and Clinics.
    “I would like students to learn about the great things happening on campus, and we’d like them to bring [forth] more ideas,” she said. “A lot of these ideas have been put up by students, so I know students are interested in sustainability.”
    Hogg called on students and community members to continue efforts in Iowa City to reach beyond the state borders.
    “This goes to the core of our economy, our security and basic humanitarian issues,” Hogg said. “You have to be involved beyond your personal life.”
    While Hogg pointed to advanced biofuels, urban revitalization, and water conservation as immediate solutions, Sen. Joe Bolkcom, D-Iowa City, noted adaption and policymaking as the next vital steps.
    “We need to make it easier for people and that’s where policy comes in,” he said, emphasizing relationships, communication, and connections as ways to implement change.
    Hogg said while he thinks the UI has made large strides toward environmental policies, he still hopes to see more.
    “The university has been making progress, [and] there are some great energy and solid waste accomplishments, but the magnitude of the challenge [means] the university needs to do a lot more,” he said. “And of course that’s not just [the UI], but everybody needs to do more.”
    Sen. Bill Dix, R-Shell Rock, did not attend the summit but said he believes people of all ages are interested in taking part in conservation efforts.
    “It’s just common sense,” he said. “It’s good for the economy, environment, and … country; all of those things contribute to a brighter future.”
    Sen. David Johnson, R-Ocheyedan, also was not in attendance at Sunday’s summit but said there is a strong push in Iowa in terms of environmentally friendly efforts.
    “There are things that every public entity should be doing as far as energy [conservation],” he said. “There are a lot of efforts out there … [and] no matter if it’s at the state or local level, there are efforts underway or should be underway.”
    Ding said he thinks many initiatives and plans could be formed from ideas discussed at the summit, contributing to UISG’s continuous efforts to support sustainability efforts campus-wide.
    “We’ll continue to market the Green Initiative Fund,” he said, in efforts to continue recycling campaigns and a possible summit involving the Tippie College of Business.

    Water research makes waves in annual graduate student sustainability challenge
    UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. -- A diverse team of judges has recognized an interdisciplinary team of graduate students as the grand prize winner of $10,000 in the Dow Sustainability Innovation Student Challenge Award (SISCA) at Penn State . Abhishek Kar (chemical engineering), Yuxi Meng (energy management and policy), Rajarshi Guha (chemical engineering) and Hasin Feroz (chemical engineering), developed a solution titled “Sustainable Desalination and Water Recycling Using Chemical Micropumps in Membrane Systems.” The faculty adviser for the team was Manish Kumar, assistant professor of chemical engineering, and Darrell Velegol, distinguished professor of chemical engineering.
    The Dow SISCA contest recognizes and rewards students and universities for their innovation and research of sustainable solutions to the world's most pressing social, economic and environmental problems. The program, administered by Penn State's Sustainability Institute, is designed to promote forward thinking in social and environmental responsibility, and acknowledges the energy, commitment and enthusiasm of students and their professors who support their innovations.
    “This contest brings people together with various scientific and technical skills and fosters an environment of change,” said Abhishek Kar, a member of the grand prize winning team.
    “The way of thinking and communicating with people from different fields is outstanding,” said Yuxi Meng, grand prize team member. “The interdisciplinary cooperation experiences in the contest are a treasure that would be difficult to gain from anywhere else.”

                                         -- Yuxi Meng, grand prize team member
    The grand prize winning team developed low-energy consuming technique for reverse osmosis, a current method of extracting clean water from sea and waste water.
    The second place team of Dustin Betz (biology), Dan Collins (industrial engineering), Jon Gumble (horticulture), Jared Yarnall-Schane (mechanical engineering), and Mike Zaengle (architecture) was awarded $2,500 for their entry: “GreenTowers: Consumer Aquaponics Systems.” The faculty adviser for the team was Timothy Simpson, professor of mechanical and industrial engineering and engineering design.
    “We are thrilled to have participated in this year’s Dow SISCA Challenge and to have won second place,” said Dustin Betz, second place team member. “We plan to use our prize winnings to turn our idea into a viable business known as GreenTowers.”
    “GreenTowers, our recently-organized Pennsylvania LLC, implements local protection of human health and the environment by using an inherently organic food production technique that always allows the consumer to know the exact origin of the food that they put into their bodies,” explained Betz. “Our team is designing for efficiency and conservation by hyper-localizing food production with one of the most water-conscious horticultural technologies available.”
    “So many great ideas were submitted, that choosing only two to fund was difficult. We encourage all participants to continue other avenues of potential funding and/or to submit again next year. The future truly lies in ideas such as these,” said Denice Wardrop, executive director of Penn State's Sustainability Institute.

  :title: Dairy Industry Sustainability Advances - Environmental Leader
  :text: |
    U.S.
    The dairy industry today produces 59 percent more milk with 64 percent fewer cows that eat 77 percent less feed and drink 65 percent less water per cwt of milk produced compared with dairy production in 1944, reports Dairy Heard Management, citing research in the Journal of Dairy Science.
    Researchers analyzed the sustainability of the US dairy industry from 1944 to 2012 and found advances in genetics, nutrition and herd management have resulted in greater efficiency — more than a four-fold increase in milk yield and a reduction in farms and cows.
    The paper also identifies factors that will affect the future sustainability of the US dairy industry including climate change and scientific and technological innovation and advances.
    Earlier this year the Innovation Center for US Dairy published a guide to help dairy companies and farms measure and report on sustainability . The Stewardship and Sustainability Guide for US Dairy identifies indicators for assessing dairy sustainability and communicating results. The indicators are based on scientific life cycle assessment studies commissioned by the Innovation Center, and the practical experience of industry members and others from nongovernmental, academic and government organizations.
    Walmart’s supplier engagement tool, the Sustainability Index, is transforming dairy sustainability , writes Cheryl Baldwin, a senior consultant for sustainability consulting firm Pure Strategies, in an August Environmental Leader column.

    Yale expands executive MBA to include sustainability focus

    The Yale School of Management (SOM) announced this month it is expanding its MBA for Executives program by offering students the ability to focus their studies in asset management or sustainability. The program is enrolling students in these areas beginning in the fall 2014.
    Yale SOM’s MBA for Executives program was launched in 2005 and initially admitted students exclusively from the healthcare sector. The program delivers a foundation in business skills, as well as in-depth study of a particular industry or sector. The expanded program is part of the school’s planned growth as it moves to a new campus, Edward P. Evans Hall , in January 2014. 
    "The new areas of focus—asset management and sustainability—are similar to our existing focus on healthcare in that they deal with big issues at the nexus of business and society," said Edward A. Snyder , dean of the Yale SOM. "The world needs leaders who understand the importance of managing people’s retirement savings, pension funds, and endowments, or addressing climate change and resource availability in a systematic way.”
    The sustainability concentration will focus on applying an integrated, sustainable approach to business as a means of driving innovation and growth in organizations. “For half a century we have dealt with traditional sustainability issues—resource availability, energy, climate change—by thinking about what you cannot do, or what you have to reduce or eliminate,” said Paul Anastas , the Teresa and H. John Heinz III Professor in the Practice of Chemistry for the Environment at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, and faculty director of the sustainability concentration. “There has been a transformation to thinking about what you can create, invent, and innovate by aligning sustainability issues with economic drivers and market forces. Now, sustainability, when done right and thoughtfully, is a competitive advantage.”
    The curriculum and contact hours for Yale’s EMBA program are identical to that of the full-time MBA program. The EMBA program includes Yale SOM’s core curriculum, Leadership Development Program, raw cases, team project work, and emphasis on global business. Classes are taught every other weekend during the 22-month program, allowing participants to continue working and developing practical expertise.

    Lawmaker Says Politicians’ Defection Good For Sustainability Of Democracy

    Tweet
    Dr Ahmad Ali, a member of the House of Representatives, on Friday in Ilorin described the country’s present political situation as being good for the sustainability of democracy.
    Ali, who is also the Chairman of the House Committee on Justice, told newsmen that carpet-crossing was an age-long aspect of democracy and had always helped in strengthening it.
    ``The situation where some politicians defected from the ruling party, PDP, to the APC will only strengthen the sustainability of the country’s democracy,’’ he said.
    The lawmaker who represents the Ilorin East and West Federal Constituency said the defection of its members would assist the ruling party to be more committed to citizens’ welfare.
    Ali, however, advised politicians not to engage in any act that would truncate the nation's democracy.

    Here’s hoping your Thanksgiving table was as full and blessed as ours. Friends and family gathered for a tradition of celebration that always makes the joy of living a little better and sweeter.
    Some little critter has been at the Asian greens in the Pantry Garden and made my choice for centerpiece in my green salad a little easier to make this year. A double head of one of the seedlings had just gotten to a nice start and something chewed it off right at the ground. Not wanting to waste it, I just took it home and rinsed in vinegar water for a bit and put it in the fridge and it was still nice and crisp for Thanksgiving. All during that rainy cold week, I loved seeing the plants just take it and smile. You should check out the lettuce bed this week. The ‘Bibb’ and ‘Tennis Ball’ are just getting good for picking. Take a leaf from several of the plants and a bagful is apparent in short order.
    We are in the process of planning for this year’s Summit Smithville EXPO on Jan. 25, 2014. A sustainability workshop and vendor showcase is planned for Main Street. As with last year’s EXPO, we expect a good showing from the world of alternative building supplies and some tips for conserving and gathering alternative energy. Our drought situation in central Texas will be the focus of our panel discussions at Playhouse Smithville. In the morning session, we’ll discuss the problems this is causing and in the afternoon we can work through some solutions of conservation, distribution and plant selection and find what is thought the future will hold for us here on the Colorado. Save the date and plan your day with us on Jan. 25.
    With these mighty cold days upon us, it’s a great time to settle in with a good book or two. Our Smithville Public Library is the perfect place to start your search and find something interesting and edifying. There’s a plethora of material in the stacks on gardening, cooking and raising animals.
    I found a little hidden gem that has my attention at the moment. Reay Tannahill’s “Food in History” is an exciting look at how food has influenced the entire course of human development. From prehistory to the present, she has shown how our quest for food has shaped the development of society in ways you wouldn’t believe. Another writer is Barbara Kingsolver, author of “The Bean Tree” and “Poisonwood Bible” and her book “Animal, Vegetable, Miracle” about abandoning the city and moving into a rural life that simply changed everything.
    For you cooks looking for a few new recipes try “Cuisine, Texas.” Joanne Smith has given us a multiethnic feast of tastes from all the ethnic groups that have settled in Texas and brought such a diverse and delicious palette to our kitchens and tables. Looking beyond the food, she includes how newcomers enriched the tapestry of Texas and served us with new and exciting foods and culture that have made us so diverse and truly Texans. Read on!
    If you’ve had a good cup of coffee and some scones from our newest neighbor, Old World Bakery on Main Street, then you’ve probably gone back for their lunch. Don’t miss this latest addition to our community. Daniel has a real knack for baking and he and his beautiful crew have given us breakfast and lunch not to be missed. They are also offering some fresh frozen meals to take home and serve the family. Hopefully, Saturdays will bring some music to town and give us another opportunity to meet and greet and share. Thanks to Old World Bakery for making the choice to stay in Bastrop County and come to Smithville. Enjoy!!

    By S. Sinan Erzurumlu
    A decade ago corporations were questioning whether they should consider social and environmental issues in conjunction with profitability. Today, a majority of global CEOs believe that sustainability issues need to be fully incorporated into their strategies and operations. If sustainability is the new path to doing business, corporate strategy must be modified to stop the economic and political manipulations, represent the real costs of business, and invest equivalently in ecologically smart infrastructure and social value generation.
    This is a call for a new generation of entrepreneurs, leaders, and thinkers to shift the management paradigm from traditional to sustainable. When I speak with various managers and entrepreneurs (in mining, high tech, clean tech, energy, manufacturing, services), they proudly (and rightfully) mention their sustainability efforts. While some of these efforts make only tiny dents in the sustainability debt, some are very innovative, but still waiting for mass adoption and a shift in thinking and behavior. I do not think less of any corporation’s sustainability efforts, even if they have not made radical change. Realizing that you have to clean up your act and make this a core discussion in your business model is a significant step. A decade ago we were still in the denial phase, and now we are having conversations on how to define and deliver sustainability, a huge step in the right direction.
    We should continue our conversations and our efforts, because first, sustainability is a continuous improvement process, and second, it will take generations to change our economic values and addictions, and instill a global culture of sustainability. On the economic front, this transformation has to start with leaders adopting the principles of sustainability thinking and generating business model innovations within the sustainability context. Some firms may tout their improvements in operational efficiency as big steps in sustainability –and these are indeed great news, considering where we have been. However, they may not be the real sustainability leaders.
    Three Principles of Sustainability Thinking
    A real sustainability leader should utilized these three principles of sustainability to achieve a fundamental transformation:
    Environment is not a public good; pollution cannot be free.
    It has been extremely cheap, and free in some cases, for businesses to use natural resources. The economic assumption of nature as an abundant resource and a limitless source for waste have led to the environment as a public good–abundant and freely accessible, like air. But, environmental resources like clean air or common-property fisheries, in the absence of regulation, are not priced or at least underpriced, meaning corporations are incentivized to use more of those resources than is socially efficient. So, the leader must fully understand the shortcoming of the traditional economic assumptions and its long term consequences.
    Further, sustainable business models are concerned with diverse stakeholders. Then, the stakeholder recognition is material to the extent of sustainable business model innovations. Our first and foremost stakeholder in our economic activities is simply Mother Nature, who is probably the most silent one when we are making our plans. Such recognition (of tragedy of the commons) shows a level of responsibility and sense of respect by the thought leader.
    Sustainability thinking is systems thinking.
    The traditional linear thinking of economic systems may not hold the organization directly responsible for procurement decisions like resource extraction and after-sales decisions like end-of-life destiny of products. Yet, goods no longer flow in one direction. The supply chain itself is extended in both directions and involves many stakeholders. The incentives of this extended network of stakeholders demand a systematic evaluation of the environmental aspects of a product system. The true leader must realize diverse interactions and assess the impacts of a business through all stages of a product’s life cycle. Then, she can make decisions with minimum impact for the longevity of the system, not necessarily for one party.
    Sustainable solutions require long term decision making.
    In a traditional growth-induced and consumption-focused business model, sustainability efforts are accepted so long as they lead to cost reduction or profitability. If the manager can show how energy efficiency is converted to cost savings; how green product differentiation increases market share; or how carbon reductions avoid costly regulations, they are hailed by the organizations. But, these decisions are focused on short term view for generating more dividends, increasing stock value or maximizing shareholder value. The solutions to the problems we are dealing with require economic and social sacrifices, short term investment loses and longer time for return on investment. Thus, the real sustainability thought leader should evaluate the impact of decisions in the long term.
    Entrepreneurial Thought and Action for Sustainability
    Without demonstrating thought and action for these three principles, a sustainability strategy merely provides a way to move on to better, yet still unsustainable, status.  The sustainability leader who develops business models with three principles of sustainability would have to generate novel ideas. Needless to say, this requires an entrepreneurial mindset. No matter how perplexing the constraints are, the entrepreneurial approach calls for optimism, experimentalism and collaboration.
    The challenge for business education is to nurture the culture of entrepreneurial sustainability thinking in their curriculum design. The MBA programs on sustainability should offer entrepreneurial thought and action (ETA) for solving “big and wicked” problems. That means educational institutions have to carry out the mission to confront the old, debate the new and make way for the innovative. Sustainability innovations promote an economic and social environment that is going to change consumer behavior, seek a different regulatory framework, and delay financial earnings. That is ambitious. That is going against the Main Street, Washington and the Wall Street. Against all, simultaneously.
    That brings another question to mind: Are the institutions responsible for educating next generation of sustainability leaders teaching a new framework for thinking, or are they simply offering to meet the needs for business as usual? I would like to see the former idea taking root in business schools. Anyone who wants to think within this framework must demand a thought and action paradigm that is going against the old economy. That is the major undertaking for the business education and that is what every MBA must demand.

    Students campaign for fossil fuel divestment
    In the last “fireside chat” of the semester, UC Berkeley students met with Chancellor Nicholas Dirks to discuss challenges in reducing waste and continuing sustainability projects on campus.
    Dirks listened to students’ concerns, which included divesting the university’s funds from fossil fuel companies in an effort to tackle climate change. Students urged that with a new UC president and UC Berkeley chancellor, now is the “prime time” to make changes on campus.
    “For me, this has been a real window onto a lot of parts of this extraordinary campus,” Dirks told attendees. “Many of the interests that you’re engaged in and many of the activities that you do help me better represent the needs of the university.”
    Students called for Dirks to push for divestment from companies with the largest reserves of carbon. In February, the ASUC Senate passed a bill that mandated divestment of all ASUC holdings from fossil fuel companies. The ASUC also placed a referendum on the spring election ballot that passed with a majority of 73 percent and called for the UC system to divest its endowment funds from the fossil fuel industry.
    “Clean investment projects aren’t going to be available if institutions like Cal and the UC don’t demand them,” said Ophir Bruck, Fossil Free Campaign coordinator. “Divestment is one of the most meaningful actions as an institution we can take right now.”
    Bruck said UC Berkeley should lead the way in actively investing in solutions to bring about a low-carbon and sustainable economy.
    Recent data on campus emissions suggest UC Berkeley may be making significant progress toward a low-carbon environment. Last month, campus officials announced that UC Berkeley met its goal of reducing carbon emissions to 1990 levels two years ahead of schedule.
    ASUC Executive Vice President Nolan Pack, however, noted that while the campus may have made progress in decreasing carbon emissions, UC Berkeley is far from reaching its goal of zero waste by 2020. He said there is insufficient funding to install landfill, mixed paper, compost and bottles bins outside every building. The campus needs administrative support to “make all the pieces fit together,” he said.
    Jeff Noven, education director at the Berkeley Student Food Collective, said that there is funding available but that it is unsustainable. For example, the Compost Alliance, a student group that is dedicated to building a campuswide compost system and a critical part of the zero-waste policy, faces the possibility of closing down because it relies on grants but is not receiving sustainable funding from the university, Noven said.
    Food is a topic relevant to sustainability and the environment that can spark student interest, said Magnolia Barrett, education director at the Student Environmental Resource Center. Several departments and the Berkeley Food Institute are discussing a proposed minor in food systems and sustainability, which would provide a formal educational structure for the study of issues related to modern food and agriculture, according to Barrett.
    The meeting was the fourth in a series of fireside chats hosted by Dirks to allow students to inform him about important issues, such as challenges faced by the undocumented community.
    “I am glad that the Chancellor even wanted to open up that discussion space,” Barrett said in an email. “However I am skeptical that anything concrete will come out of it … I would be really inspired and surprised if he makes some concrete steps towards even a few of the issues discussed.”

    Posted: Dec 18, 2013 – 10:17 AM EST
     
    WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 /CSRwire/ -  The Global Initiative for Sustainability Ratings (GISR) today announced the key set of core Principles it will use for accrediting sustainability ratings worldwide.
    The year long effort included close participation from leaders in the investment and corporate communities – among those, Aviva, Deutsche Bank, Bloomberg L.P., BBVA, TIAA-CREF and UBS who are members of GISR’s core committees; and AMD, UPS, Vale, Disney, Bosch and Bayer who are members of GISR’s technical working group.
    Launched by Ceres and the Tellus Institute in 2011, GISR is a global non-profit initiative that aims to accelerate the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues and indicators into global financial markets and investment decision-making. GISR will not rate companies on sustainability measures, but will instead accredit sustainability ratings, rankings or indices that meet certain standards of excellence for assessing corporate sustainability performance.
    "The number of investor, company and NGO participants in various GISR activities has doubled over the past 12 months, a trend we expect to continue in the coming year,” said Allen White, vice president of the Tellus Institute and founder of GISR. “The hundreds of comments received on the draft Principles provide additional evidence of GISR’s growing worldwide profile.”
    Currently, more than 100 rating systems are evaluating various aspects of the ESG performance of more than 10,000 companies using more than 400 issues and 2,000 indicators. In collaboration with the sustainability ratings community, NGOs, investors and companies, GISR aims to further harmonize and expand the global market for high quality sustainability ratings, rankings and indices.
    “To those of us working to improve corporate performance on climate change and other sustainability challenges, the need for standards is clear,” said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit group mobilizing business leadership on sustainability challenges. “Investors are increasingly evaluating companies in terms of their ability to meet sustainability challenges and they are seeking assurance that a rating system provides an accurate picture of how well a company is building the natural, social and human capital needed to operate sustainably well into the 21st century.”
    The GISR standard will comprise three components: Principles, Issues and Indicators. The Principles, announced today, identify the core attributes of a ratings framework applicable to all sustainability ratings, rankings and indices. “Issues” are themes, topics or aspects of sustainability material used to assess a company’s sustainability performance, such as water stewardship, carbon emissions and human rights.
    After a year-long development process including hundreds of comments from interested parties, the principles released today include: continuous improvement, impartiality, balance, and transparency. Additionally, the principles cover: incorporation of stakeholders whose investment decisions are influenced by sustainability ratings; focus on issues material to investors; inclusion of a rated company’s value chain in performance assessment; and comparability across rated companies while avoiding an overly prescriptive or rigid approach to ratings.
    “GISR is seeking to highlight leading groups doing an excellent job of rating corporate sustainability performance, while encouraging all raters to achieve a continuously higher level of excellence,” White said. “That doesn’t mean there’s only one credible way to measure sustainability performance, but it does mean that credible systems should rest on certain common principles. Once they know which ratings systems align with such principles, we anticipate a major expansion of the ratings market worldwide.”
    “GISR’s goal is to create a benchmark of excellence that will bolster investor confidence in and reliance upon sustainability ratings,” said GISR Program Manager, Mark Tulay. “This, in turn, will grow the market for ratings and unleash their full potential to move capital toward true sustainability leaders. In a world fraught with uncertainty, such outcomes will play a vital role in bringing long-term prosperity to investors, companies and society at-large.”

    COMING CLEAN DECEMBER 4, 2013
    Companies Are Ditching Environmental Schemes that Can't Pay for Themselves. Good.
    Share
    In 2007, General Electric, that model of the American industrial establishment, dipped its toe into frothy green waters. It entered the solar-panel business. GE bought a piece of PrimeStar Solar, a little Colorado-based solar-panel maker whose technology GE believed was cutting-edge. The deal, which GE later expanded by buying the rest of PrimeStar, was tiny by GE standards, but it was strategically significant for the multinational giant. It was in line with “Ecomagination,” GE’s then-fledgling corporate campaign to demonstrate it could simultaneously help the earth and enrich its shareholders.
    It didn’t take. This past summer, with solar-panel prices tanking, GE ditched what had been PrimeStar , concluding that making solar panels in the United States wasn’t such a great business after all. GE sold the solar-panel technology to another U.S. solar firm for stock, in the process jettisoning GE’s previously announced plans to build, in Colorado, a $300 million factory to crank out the panels. The exit was a blow to GE brass, to Colorado clean-energy boosters, and, more broadly, to the heavily hyped notion of a coming wave of American “green jobs.” Had it been built, the Colorado facility would have been the biggest solar-panel factory in the U.S.
    GE’s solar-power comeuppance is one small example of a reality check hitting companies, governments and consumers around the world: In trying to minimize humanity’s environmental footprint, generating warm fuzzies is one thing, but generating affordable and material environmental progress is something else. The work is expensive, inconvenient, controversial and complex. There’s no quick fix, and every supposed solution brings new problems of its own. The benefits – both environmental and financial – tend to come in unremarkable, incremental bits, not in some jaw-dropping windfall.
    Too bad.
    And high time.
    Economic carnage is mounting from what now looks like the first phase of the modern “sustainability” crusade, a period in which the spending often was profligate and the returns— both environmental and financial— often were poor. Now come signs that, in a nascent second phase of the green endeavor, business leaders and policymakers are shifting to more economically efficient paths. So the wags who quip that “green growth” is an oxymoron, and the marketers who flog every new environmental technology as a silver bullet, are equally wrong. The green push — more specifically, the pursuit of affordable ways to use natural resources less wastefully — is neither dead nor inevitable. It may succeed; it may flop. Right now, tough lessons are being learned. That’s a necessary step in what, even under the rosiest scenario, is going to be an epic slog.
    What’s so hard about today’s environmental challenges, at least the big remaining ones in industrialized countries such as the United States, has more to do with psychology than with technology. The difficulty is that the most evident environmental problems were long ago solved. Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River no longer burns with industrial waste. Cars no longer commonly belch plumes of smoke. In their day, these problems were widely seen as crises. They posed technological challenges. But crises tend to spur innovation.
    The environmental problems topping today’s list — climate change, water shortages, population growth, urban sprawl — are tougher. They’re tougher mainly because they’re inchoate and incremental, which means they don’t strike most people as crucial to solve. As an economist would say, the opportunity cost of tackling them is widely seen as outweighing the expected benefit. As a physicist would say, inertia is a powerful force.
    Polling bears this out. According to the Pew Research Center , 52% of Americans said this past January that protecting the environment was a top priority, a big jump from the 41% who said so four years earlier. Yet protecting the environment apparently doesn’t mean changing the energy system or curbing greenhouse-gas emissions. Just 45% of Americans said dealing with the “energy problem” was a top priority, down from the 60% who said so in 2009. Only 28% of Americans called dealing with global warming a top priority, down a tad from 30% four years ago.
    Faced with this collective public yawn, many environmental activists have chosen to bang the drums and spread the message that the earth really does face an apocalypse. Alas, there’s not much evidence this strategy works over time. For awhile, it may spark enough of a sense of crisis to propel some action. But then the concern wears off and the action winds down.
    This, in essence, has been the trajectory of the first phase of the modern sustainability push. In 2005, amid mounting scientific warnings about the dangers of global warming, the European Union slapped a price on carbon-dioxide emissions; the rules forced businesses constituting a large swathe of the E.U.’s industrial economy to curb their emissions or to buy permits to pollute. In 2007, the year after the release of Al Gore’s cinematic cri de coeur about climate change, An Inconvenient Truth, GE bought its stake in the Colorado solar-panel maker PrimeStar. At the time, GE was just one of dozens of companies making similar renewable-energy investments. The rationale: A combination of government incentives, consumer interest and technological innovation would boost the market for solar power, making it a profitable piece of the energy business.
    What did that spasm of green spending produce? Environmentally speaking, not a lot. The price of a European permit allowing the bearer to emit a ton of carbon dioxide has plummeted, from about 30 euros in 2005 to about 5 euros today. That’s a fair sign the market isn’t inducing much change. Even if Europe’s carbon market had thrived, it wouldn’t have done much for the atmosphere, because the developing world — a place not covered by Europe’s carbon policies — is expected to produce virtually all the growth in global greenhouse-gas output in coming years. As for renewable-energy investments by companies such as GE, they’ve helped slash the price of solar panels and wind turbines, no small achievement. Yet renewable energy remains a small slice of the global energy pie, and greenhouse-gas emissions continue to rise, largely because the developing world is burning more coal and oil than ever.
    But just because the first round of modern environmental spending has been inefficient doesn’t mean the next round must be too. Today, institutions with unsentimental investors are ramping up strategies that could accelerate a shift toward an economy that uses natural resources more efficiently — a shift that will stick to the extent that it proves lucrative. Big electric utilities are buying into the renewable-energy business, often more aggressively than governmental clean-energy mandates require them to do. To be sure, they’re angling to look green, they’re still making most of their power profit from fossil fuel, and often they’re lobbying against tougher renewable-energy policies even as they make those investments. What’s changing, though, is that they’ve decided that renewable energy has grown too big to ignore. Utilities that set investment strategy for decades, not just for months or years, are concluding that the cost of renewable energy has declined to the point that, in some places, it’s competitive with conventional power.
    Similarly, the World Bank has said it no longer will bankroll the construction of coal-fired power plants in the developing world except in “rare circumstances.” The bank’s primary mission is to facilitate economic development in poor countries, so it can’t justify purely bleeding-heart initiatives. The new stance is a bet that cleaner energy sources have gotten sufficiently economical to enter the mainstream.
    One of Saudi Arabia’s longest-serving oil ministers, Sheikh Zaki Yamani, who presided over the Arab oil embargo that so dislocated many Western economies in the 1970s, once offered a wry and wise analysis of what drives changes in peoples’ use of natural resources. “The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone,” he said, “and the oil age will end long before the world runs out of oil.” What he meant is that the most enduring shifts are propelled not by pushes but by pulls. It’s not that the status quo suddenly gets intolerable; it’s that an alternative ultimately gets more alluring.
    Over the past generation, the signal environmental gains have been driven by pushes. Anger at the sight of a burning river pushed Cleveland to clean up the Cuyahoga. Horror about lung-clogging air pushed Los Angeles to clean up its smoggy skies. Fear of reliance on expensive imported oil and gas pushed Japan and Germany to ramp up domestic nuclear, wind and solar power.
    With many of today’s big environmental challenges, however, waiting for pushes to drive action may not work. If many of the scientists who study these things are to be believed, the pushes, by the time they’re palpable, could prove catastrophic. One way to understand the turmoil now buffeting the environmental markets, then, is as a structural reset – a paradigm shift from push to pull. The first phase of the sustainability effort sought largely to compel society to change. At issue now is whether, in a second phase, the change can be made so attractive – among other things, inexpensive – that people choose it. If this transition fails, taxpayers and investors may lose many billions of dollars. If it succeeds, an economy that uses natural resources more efficiently may prove, well, sustainable.

  :title: Verdantix Names Top Sustainability Assurance Suppliers - Environmental Leader
  :text: |
    Sustainable Supply Chain
    Bureau Veritas, Deloitte, DNV, EY, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) are the six leading suppliers of sustainability assurance, according to a Verdantix report.
    Increased scrutiny of environmental, social and governance disclosures in financial and sustainability reports will require Fortune 500 firms to seek much more comprehensive assurance of their sustainability data and controls in 2014, the analyst firm says. It recommends corporations with a global footprint turn to one of these six companies for assurance engagements across GHG data, CDP disclosures, sustainability reports, supply chain compliance, product sustainability and sustainability management systems.
    The report, Green Quadrant: Sustainability Assurance (Global) , is the third Verdantix benchmark of sustainability assurance providers. The study identifies 29 notable providers of sustainability assurance but found only nine had the capabilities to deliver globally. The comparison of the global providers — which includes Environ, ERM CVS and SGS — is based on 63 assessment criteria and in-depth interviews with 15 customers with collective revenues of $351 billion.
    The six market leaders have established market positions ahead of other firms due to their:
    Long client lists across all sectors and geographies. Leading firms provide an assurance statement for at least 100 sustainability reports annually. For example, Bureau Veritas has assured the reporting of AstraZeneca, Lukoil, Nestlé and Network Rail.
    Broad service offerings that integrate many expertise areas. Financial audit firms staff assurance teams with experts from their audit practices, sustainability consulting teams and industry practice groups — meeting the buying criteria of complex, global corporations.
    Commitment to shaping market standards. The leaders shape the market through the technical committees and working groups of organizations such as the CDP, the Global Reporting Initiative, the International Accounting Standards Board, and the International Integrated Reporting Council.
    Long-running marketing programs to drive awareness. The Big Four financial audit firms in particular have published numerous thought leadership reports on sustainability reporting and assurance to help corporations understand the value of assurance.
    Innovation for product and supply chain sustainability. DNV earned the top score for product sustainability assurance. It has invested in product water footprints as well as creating its own standard, ProSustain, against which clients can have their management system or products certified.
    The value of undertaking assurance of sustainability data, reports and management systems is gaining traction worldwide, according to data from a related Verdantix survey of 250 heads of sustainability in 13 countries. The survey found that 46 percent of the 250 firms interviewed currently pay for assurance of their greenhouse gas data and 39 percent invest in assurance of their sustainability reports.
    While more than half (53 percent) of all companies in the S&P 500 Index and Fortune 500 published sustainability reports in 2011 — up from 19 percent the year before — companies in the US are less likely to obtain third-party assurance than their global peers, according to a report by the Global Reporting Initiative published earlier this year.

    Throw an Eco-Friendly Party With Sustainable Supplies

    The concept of a carbon footprint is simple — our lifestyles affect the planet on which we live. The sustainability movement simply asks that we leave the world a better place than we found it — and it seems like the right thing to do, because it's hard. Convenience is king, and we don't like to give up our plastic bags and water bottles.
    But the heart of the sustainability movement is not about being dry, boring and self-righteous. Emily Doubilet , founder of Susty Party , considers creativity to be at the center.

    In making sustainability fun, Susty Party most notably has made it colorful. Mashable spoke with Doubilet to learn more about launching a product line in the ecommerce era and the ins and outs of how social media can drive brand awareness.
    Q&A With Emily Doubilet, Founder of Susty Party
    Mashable: How did you get started?
    Doubilet: We launched Sustainable Party in 2009 and it evolved into Susty Party as we began to form our own brand of products. We launched the Susty Party colorful compostable starch plates, our first retail product, in May 2012.
    Image: Susty Party
    How has sustainability changed over the past few years?
    We created Susty Party because we felt that sustainability should be a celebration! The sustainability movement should be fun — why not involve aesthetically appealing straws? At Oberlin College, where I graduated with a degree in Environmental Studies in 2006, I read Cradle to Cradle by William McDonough and Michael Braungart, and its premise is still radical today: “What if humans designed products and systems that celebrate an abundance of human creativity, culture, and productivity? That are so intelligent and safe, our species leaves an ecological footprint to delight in, not lament?”
    In the past few years, sustainable products have started to have more personality. Our world is shifting toward sustainability now — which is awesome! We feel that this movement towards sustainable lifestyles will continue to spark creativity, celebration and delight.
    What's changed in ecommerce since you first started?
    We are continually working to optimize our website, blog and social media avenues in order to communicate most effectively. As technology continues to improve, so does the demand for transparency and responsibility. We look for ways to be more and more accountable to our customers. We constantly re-evaluate: How can we openly, honestly communicate with all our stakeholders and offer them the most innovative, eco-friendly and socially-good products? I'm happy that there's a growing importance on building real relationships and on transparency.
    You make original products as well as curate approved products from other companies — what made you decide to do it this way?
    We started by scouring the earth for the most sustainable party supplies that were being made (or could be made!), convincing companies and scientists to work with us and curating these products into a one-stop-shop that I had envisioned as an online destination to help people throw sustainable parties. We still have a free best practices guide, and free party signage, available to download on the site in order to help people host events that cut down on waste, and operate in an eco-friendly and socially responsible way.
    But as we evolved, we realized there were gaps in the market. We couldn't find products that were colorful, compostable and responsibly made in the USA! We wanted stylish and sustainable items, so we set off to do it our own way, and Susty Party's product line was born.
    We still sell other brands on our website, because we don't want to limit people's options and we feel the more sustainable party product innovation on the market, the better. If it is an awesome party-friendly and responsibly-made product, we'd like to offer it to our customers.
    Image: Susty Party
    What's the biggest challenge for you in finding customers online?
    The biggest challenge is figuring out how to get the word out that we exist. And how to do it on the cheap — as we still operate on a boot-strapped budget. So we're experimenting a lot with how to optimize the friendly world of social media. We work to find the outlets that are most effective for our company — and it is an ongoing process.
    We are learning that just because Twitter works great for one company, it doesn't mean it will necessarily do wonders for us. One day we checked our numbers and were surprised to see Pinterest was actually driving the most customers to our site, so we have made Pinterest a priority. We've learned to be flexible and to continue to experiment with various strategies until we find one the works best.
    Tell me about the best party you've been to this year.
    Our Brooklyn showcase party this summer was a blast and the video photobooth speaks for itself:
    We basically convinced our interns to throw us a Susty party.
    And as a runner up: Natural Products Expo is a twice-annual trade show of companies that sell, you guessed it, natural products. The East show is in Baltimore in the fall. This year our good friends at Runa Tea rented a houseboat instead of staying in a hotel. They invited a bunch of companies and industry folks over one night and it was a great time. We drank Runa cocktails out of Susty Party cups, with Susty Party straws, of course! There was music, dancing and an amazing sunset. The West show is in Anaheim, California this spring. We already have plans in the works for a party to rival Runa's houseboat fiesta.
    What's next for Susty Party?
    We are gearing up to launch a whole new product line in 2014. The new line includes: printed wooden cutlery, a larger paper cup, a non-GMO PLA cup to rival the SOLO cup, cocktail straws, napkins and the world's first bioplastic tablecloth. We have all hands on deck right now getting the product designs finalized, manufactured and in select stores by January.

    Ecova Survey Reveals 2014 Energy and Sustainability Predictions
    Report offers insights from leading professionals on the top challenges and opportunities for 2014
    SPOKANE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 18, 2013--
    Ecova, the total energy and sustainability management company, today released results of a broad survey in a new report: 2014 Energy and Sustainability Predictions: Findings from Leading Professionals. The report aggregates findings from a survey of nearly 500 energy and sustainability professionals, and reveals that 2014 will be a challenging year for those responsible for managing resources for their organizations.
    "These results are not surprising -- the industry landscape is constantly evolving and companies are facing unprecedented pressure to conserve resources, reduce costs and disclose energy and resource performance," said Jeff Heggedahl, president and CEO, Ecova. "These challenges mean companies must take steps to improve results and build a total energy and sustainability management strategy if they want to remain competitive and meet the increasing needs for resource management."
    Nearly half of respondents revealed the top energy data priority for 2014 is to implement no cost, low cost efficiency efforts. Cost is by far the biggest influencer of energy and sustainability initiatives; however, 2014 will be complicated by the anticipated increased energy and resource prices.
    The report discloses additional aspects of energy and sustainability management for organizations to address in 2014:
    Water will emerge as a top energy and sustainability initiative
    -- An overwhelming majority of respondents (70 percent) noted that rising        water costs are a concern for 2014.       -- Water is also viewed as the second greatest area with opportunity for        savings and improvement, behind energy.
    New benchmarking regulations create an increasingly complex environment
    -- Thirty percent of respondents are unaware if their buildings are        currently required or will be required to comply with municipal, city or        state level regulations.       -- However, among the 38 percent of respondents who are currently required        or expect to be required to comply with municipal, city or state        regulations, nearly 86 percent feel prepared to respond.
    Peer benchmarking represents an untapped opportunity
    -- Twenty-seven percent of respondents acknowledged they didn't know how        their facilities performed in comparison to peers, and an additional 46        percent stated their buildings were performing only the same as or less        efficiently than peers.       -- This means that nearly 75 percent of respondents believe they have an        opportunity to capture additional cost and energy savings compared to        their current performance.
    About the Survey
    The Ecova 2014 Energy and Sustainability Predictions report was conducted by Ecova in November and December, 2013. The results are based on responses from more than 500 energy and sustainability professionals from a wide variety of organizations across the United States. The respondents represent a broad spectrum of those involved with managing their company's energy and sustainability efforts--C-Suite executives, energy managers, directors and analysts--and were drawn from a wide range of company sizes.

    10 years after clearcutting
    The European Union is pushing member states to go green -- offering incentives and requiring that utilities cut their carbon emissions and increase their use of renewable energy sources by 20%.  That sounds like a noble goal, but it may be having unintended consequences in Virginia and neighboring states – consequences that have some environmentalists up in arms. 
    Listen
    Sandy Hausman reports.
    Derb Carter is an avid birder who uses recordings to draw birds toward his binoculars in a forest along the Roanoke River in Eastern North Carolina. “Birds are territorial, and if the bird thinks there’s another red bellied woodpecker in the territory, he or she will come in to inspect.”
    And sure enough, a red bellied woodpecker shows up.  Carter is pleased, but he worries about the future of birds like this one.  
    “Thirty species of migratory songbirds – they’re rare, declining or some actually listed as threatened or endangered -- are dependent on these bottomland hardwood forests.”
    And the forests are coming down – perhaps because demand is heating up, as European power plants switch from coal to wood.  Elizabeth Woodworth is with Bethesda-based Enviva, the nation’s largest maker of wood pellets.  
    “We use low grade byproducts of other lumber industries – so industries that are making furniture and flooring and railroad ties, etc,  and that includes saw dust, wood chips, tops and limbs of trees that otherwise wouldn’t have another market," says Woodworth.
    And, she says,  about 25% of its raw materials comes from whole trees that are too small, crooked or diseased to be used as lumber, or from managed forests.
    “They thin out smaller or defective trees out of a forest to ensure that the higher value trees have the sunlight and the nutrients to grow as tall as possible," she says.
    But after multiple visits and flights over Enviva mills,  the Southern Environmental Law Center believes the company, which has three plants in Virginia and North Carolina, depends primarily on whole trees – some of them 80-100 years old, clear cut from bottomland forests.
    Outside this pellet mill, 135 miles east of Durham, a steady stream of trucks arrives loaded with logs.  They’re piled 30 feet high, waiting to be chopped up and pressed into pellets.  Bird lover Derb Carter, who is also a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, has shared pictures of the site with officials at the European Union, who believed pellets were coming from forests that were sustainably managed. 
    "In the Southern United States, 87% of the forest is privately owned.  There’s no requirement that you get a permit or authorization to cut a forest.  You don’t have to replant a forest, and in fact we continue to lose forest at an alarming rate to urbanization and development and other uses.”
    Enviva says it only takes wood from working forests – not from preserves or properties being developed, and gets GPS coordinates from truckers, so it can trace the wood coming in.  
    “In addition, our suppliers, our loggers are contractually required by Enviva to comply with all best management practices which are developed and implemented by the state forest service to ensure that forest operations do not have a negative impact on water quality of sensitive ecosystems of habitats.”
    Woodworth adds that the land in question has been harvested before, and hardwood forests are not being cut solely for wood pellets, a claim echoed by Charlie Becker with Virginia’s Department of Forestry.
    “Pellets and pulp tend to be lower value products, and if you own something, you want to get the most money out of it that you can, so you wouldn’t take high quality wood that could be used for furniture or veneer or nice building construction and have it ground up and put into a low value product.”
    Still, being able to sell lower quality wood along with high quality trees makes it more profitable for landowners to harvest their trees, and demand for pellets has risen dramatically.  Exports last year were up 70%.   
    Becker says a strong market for wood actually protects forests, since landowners are less likely to convert them to farms or subdivisions if they’re generating occasional revenue, and with proper management hardwood forests grow back.  Young trees absorb more carbon than the old ones, and while the new woodland evolves, wildlife goes elsewhere.
    “Unless it’s very critical forest for very critical wildlife, they’re just going to move over to the adjacent forest.”
    To a point, says Derb Carter, but when large amounts of habitat are lost, populations drop, and SELC predicts a lot of forest will be cut over a 25-year period to supply the pellet industry. 
    “These facilities would require harvesting about 750 square miles of forest, which is almost the size of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park.  The state of North Carolina is in the process of making a decision to build facilities at each of the state ports -- Morehead City and Wilmington – to export pellets to Europe.”
    Concerns about wildlife aside, Derb Carter wonders if this whole approach to mitigating climate change really makes sense.
    “We’re cutting forest over here, which requires energy, processing them into pellets, transporting them to a port, putting them on a boat burning diesel fuel to haul them all the way across the Atlantic to again transport them to a utility to burn instead of coal.”
    Enviva says it’s taken all those things into account and wood still comes out better than coal when you’re talking about carbon dioxide emission, but trees normally store carbon, and when they’re burned, it’s released.  What’s more, Carter says this renewable resource grows back slowly. “That’s going to take 80 to 100 years to occur, and because it takes more wood than coal to create the same amount of energy, we’re actually going to be putting much more carbon into the atmosphere for many decades than we would if we burned coal.”
    The Virginia Department of Forestry continuously monitors the state’s woodlands, and Charlie Becker says  government programs and other assistance could be expanded if too much forest is lost.
    “I mean we are concerned with the sustainability, and this is why we track.”
    In the mean time, the European Union is assessing the sustainability of wood pellets – planning to issue a report early next year.  Unless its policy changes, experts say pellet exports from the Southeastern United States will double by 2016.

    Last week, I was checking out at my neighborhood pharmacy (part of a national chain) and shoved the 12-inch receipt into my purse with the usual irritation. Don’t get me wrong, I am all about discounts. I reviewed the receipt later and tore off a coupon for future use.
    But I threw three-quarters of the receipt into my recycle bin, thinking, “Does it really have to be that long? How many other people just throw that into the trash?”
    They have obviously been tracking my purchases through their rewards program. They sometimes "get it right" with coupons for the products I regularly purchase — but often they don’t. It occurred to me that this practice, while state-of-the-art when it comes to targeted discounting, actually flies in the face of their growing sustainability as evidenced by the product lines they’ve recently added and the initiatives touted in their corporate sustainability report.
    Judging by the Facebook activity on this topic , I’m obviously not the only one who’s had this thought.
    The point is that your sustainability story is cumulative. Almost everything you do either adds to it or subtracts from it.
    Another example: Apple, a company that has led the electronics industry in some areas of sustainability (particularly product content), has recently come under fire for so-called " planned obsolescence. " I have experienced this issue first-hand, as well. In addition to my phone’s rapidly-diminishing charge life, I was chagrined to learn that when I upgraded to my iPhone 5, my charging accessories no longer worked. I had to buy all new ones.
    Finally, Walmart, the retail poster child for sustainability, has made great progress in packaging reduction with manufacturers in some categories, like detergents and personal care, but they have a long way to go with toys.
    I recently purchased a gift for a little girl that was packaged in such a way that it took 10 minutes and a pair of scissors (which will now no longer cut paper) to get into it. I shudder to think about the mounds of plastic that will be sitting outside American homes (hopefully in recycle bins) on the first trash pick-up day after Christmas.
    Companies should think through all of their processes and practices and ask themselves if they are doing things that contradict what they’re saying about sustainability — because actions speak much louder than words.

    China’s Forest Sustainability Packs Global Impact
    December 20, 2013

    As China increases its forests, a Michigan State University (MSU) sustainability scholar proposes a new way to answer the question: if a tree doesn’t fall in China, can you hear it elsewhere in the world?
    In this week’s journal Asia and the Pacific Policy Studies, MSU’s University Distinguished Professor Jianguo “Jack” Liu dissects the global impact of China’s struggle to preserve and expand its forests even as its cities and population balloon.
    Because China’s supersized global role makes each domestic decision a world event, Liu shows how China’s efforts to sustain forests influences other countries, and in turn how those changes may rebound to China. He is the author of “ Forest Sustainability in China and Implications for a Telecoupled World .”
    “For a long time, many scientists have focused specifically on one place to understand environmental impact, but that no longer is enough,” said Liu, the director of MSU’s Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability and the Rachel Carson Chair in Sustainability. “Economic development and environmental conservation in one place are increasingly having substantial influence elsewhere, and spill over into places we don’t consider.”
    Deforestation that eases in China tends to reappear in the countries that sell them lumber and food to meet their ravenous appetite for housing and furniture as well as food. But Liu notes that that’s just the beginning. He deploys the telecoupling framework – a new multidisciplinary research tool that embraces the minutia of give and take. Telecoupling is socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances. It goes beyond the idea of connection, as telecoupling factors in actions and reactions over distances.
    In the past three decades, China has succeeded in increasing its forest cover. Sweeping policies that limit logging or encourage returning farmland to forest are credited with some of the success. Importing food, such as soybean and meat, and forest products like timber or wood furniture, also contributes. But that seems to have caused forests to decline in the countries selling the forest goods to China, as well as a spray of other impacts.
    Importing food to China can allow more land to be returned to forest in China, yet when food demand from China becomes higher, farmers in other countries such as Brazil have more incentive to mow forests down or intensify agriculture by applying more fertilizers and pesticides.
    Liu has introduces the telecoupling framework as an integrated way to understand how distance is shrinking and connections are strengthening between nature and humans.
    Liu also shows there’s more to this than trade. He points out how growing foreign investment in China has led to more houses, factories and infrastructure, all of which carve into forests. Even getting smarter – and sharing knowledge and technology more freely – can benefit or harm forests. Spreading the message of environmental protection can be a forest’s friend, while spreading knowledge of technology can make powerful, efficient machinery available that harvests forests more efficiently.
    And telecoupling science also allows scientists to consider “spillover” systems – the countries that are left out of the direct equations of trade between China and its partners in food and forest goods, but who produce the machinery to harvest and transport timber, or process timber, or even are home to routes for smugglers.
    “The days of simply looking at sustainability at one place are over,” Liu said. “We need to understand how the world really works and acknowledge that the world isn’t as big and disconnected as we sometimes treat it. “

    To end poverty we also need to ensure equality and sustainability
    There's more bang for every development buck when reducing poverty also boosts gender equality, health and the environment

    There seems to be strong political will to do what is needed to end poverty once and for all. But what, concretely, do we need to do? Many things, if we're going to do it right.
    It is clearly not only a question of growth, although growth, of course, is essential. Through strong – and targeted – growth, China has been able to bring 600 million people out of poverty. Yet at the same time, economic growth is causing pollution and fuelling climate change, and its benefits are not always shared equally, leaving out women and other vulnerable groups.
    Does this complicate matters? Perhaps, but it may actually be easier to try to do it all at once. There is more bang for every development buck when reducing poverty also improves health, environmental sustainability and gender equality . Examples abound.
    Cash transfer schemes, for instance, can help poor people to buy food, secure housing or invest in livelihoods – whatever they believe their family most urgently needs. In Brazil, however, Bolsa Familia cash payments have a few strings attached. They require that families have their children vaccinated and enrolled in schools, and the cash is usually given to the woman in the family because they tend to know best how to use money for the benefit of the whole family. In this way, Bolsa Familia has empowered women to improve education and health while reducing the number of poor people.
    Poverty reduction can also be green and fair. People often feel they have good reason to cut down rainforests – to provide a living for their families – but when offered an alternative, may be more than willing to protect the land. Costa Rica revolutionised conservation by providing cash payments for environmental services on the premise that those who maintain natural resources should be compensated for doing so. Forests now cover more than 50% of Costa Rica's land , compared with 21% in 1980. Through the UN, several other countries are working to replicate this success.
    Agricultural reform can promote growth and equality. By building roads, establishing property rights, giving loans, and providing irrigation and better seeds, some governments – China's, for example – have targeted growth to benefit poor farmers, and in doing so have produced nationwide benefits. It's important to remember that around 70% of farmers in the world are women – often poor women in the countryside who rely on small patches of land. Today, many support programmes are still targeted at men, with women's work counted as domestic chores. The UN has estimated that bringing female farmers' yields to the level of those produced by men could reduce the number of hungry people by 100 million.
    Microcredit programmes, properly designed, can have environmental as well as social advantages. Originally created for women and others who were excluded from most sources of loans, microcredit has helped to confirm the potential of women across the world, proving that they can be good entrepreneurs given the chance. In the mountains of Vietnam, a poverty reduction programme found that men were too reckless and ambitious with their investments, and demanded female leadership as a loan condition.
    Solar Sister in rural South Africa has generated $46 for every $1 invested in solar power. This is especially important when we consider that 3 billion people still rely on wood or some other biomass for cooking. Aside from being time consuming, such practices can strip local areas of trees – and, most important, using these fuels indoors is bad for health.
    We must learn from these examples. Balancing economic growth and equality with environmental sustainability is not only possible – it is essential. No country can reach its full potential without half of its workforce and creative talent. Gender equality in the workforce grows the economy by increasing productivity and creative capacity. By the same token, while we need to understand that developing countries will not sacrifice development for the environment, it is also crucial to remember that development comes to a stop if natural resources are exhausted, water polluted and soil degraded in the process.
    No country has yet achieved environmental sustainability, but some countries are making progress. Brazil has reduced poverty and inequality while cutting deforestation by 80%. Ethiopia's growth has mainly benefited the poor, and the country aims to become a middle-income nation without increasing its carbon emissions.
    Sustainability and equality are requirements for development. Getting three times the benefit from the same effort makes common sense.

    Ski Area Environmental Sustainability Efforts

    Outdoor recreation, scenic views, clean air, and a natural mountain environment are just some of the great benefits of having ski areas as our playgrounds. What's better than a clear mountain view on a sunny day on the slopes? But running ski lifts, operating snowmaking equipment, powering lights for night skiing, running a grooming fleet, and many other aspects of a ski area's operations require a lot of power and produce a lot of pollution. Protecting the environment is important to a lot of ski areas (as well as to most of their customers), and many have taken steps to reduce their energy consumption, increase recycling, and improve their overall environmental sustainability.
    So what are ski areas actually doing to preserve the environment and the climate? The National Ski Areas Association (NSAA) has several programs in place to measure, encourage and acknowledge ski areas' efforts to protect the environment and operate in an environmentally sustainable manner. Sustainable Slopes is the primary program that NSAA uses to track the ski resort industry's progress towards greater environmental sustainability. The program monitors individual ski area efforts at reducing fuel consumption, investing in higher efficiency equipment, increasing recycling efforts, promoting clean water, and many other factors.
    Here's a quick rundown of some of the highlights of the 13th annual Sustainable Slopes report, released on October 11, 2013.
    Environmental Charter. More than 190 ski areas have endorsed the Environmental Charter over the past 12 years. By endorsing the Charter, these ski areas have appointed an individual on staff to be the environmental contact person and have measured their own policies and operations against the Environmental Principles in the Charter.
    Climate Challenge. The primary method for measuring progress toward environmental goals as set in the Environmental Charter is through the Climate Challenge . According to NSAA, the program, "is designed to give technical support and recognition to ski areas that are developing carbon inventories, setting goals for carbon reduction, and measuring success in reducing their overall carbon footprint." The list of ski areas stepping up to the Climate Challenge highlights those that have shown a commitment to the environment, and include ski areas large and small, in all regions of the country.
    Sustainable Slopes Grant Program. NSAA has coordinated with sponsors to provide ski areas with cash and in-kind grants to improve their environmental sustainability. Two ski areas -- Giants Ridge in Minnesota and Greek Peak in New York -- were awarded in-kind snowmaking efficiency grants, with each ski area receiving 5 high-efficiency snowmaking guns from HKD Turbo (a program sponsor). Additionally, two cash grants were provided to Mt. Ashland ( Oregon ) and Arapahoe Basin ( Colorado ) as part of the program. Canyons Resort in Utah was awarded a fifth grant, an in-kind energy audit donated by Brendle Group .
    Climate Declaration. Joining a group of leading US companies (including General Motors, Nike, Starbucks, Levi Strauss, and founding signatory Aspen Snowmass ), 115 ski areas signed the Climate Declaration issued by BICEP (Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy). This declaration urges lawmakers to take action to address climate change, and also states that addressing climate change is one of the greatest economic opportunities of the 21st century. It's very cool to see the ski industry step up to join leading national companies in such an important effort!
    Meetings and Conferences. For the first time, the NSAA Winter Conferences will have a dedicated sustainability track in the program. These two conferences (one in the east at Mount Snow , Vermont and one in the west at Steamboat, Colorado ) are primary industry meetings for ski area personnel and staff. Topics will include the economics of sustainability, environmental regulatory compliance, efficient snowmaking, and other topics about environmental sustainability.
    So what can you do? Here are a couple ways skiers and snowboarders can join the fight against climate change and improve the environment.
    Protect Our Winters (POW) . This non-profit group is leading the charge for winter enthusiasts who want to make a difference addressing the issue of climate change. The organization has lobbied lawmakers in Washington, DC several times and includes well-knows pro ski and snowboard such Gretchen Blieler, Chris Davenport, and Jeremy Jones, and industry brands like K2, Patagonia, Burton, and many others. You can join POW in their efforts by becoming a member here.
    National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) . This organization is a leader on many different issues affecting our planet, from preserving wildlife habit to protecting clean water supplies. Fighting global warming is also one of their key issues. They focus heavily on lobbying lawmakers and stimulating direct citizen action. To learn more or to join, click here .
    As well, numerous outdoor companies are heavily involved in donating to environmental non-profits, including Patagonia, Clif Bar, Burton, The North Face, and many, many others.
    Working together, ski areas and their customers can reduce pollution and carbon output, preserving the fresh air and beautiful mountain views for years to come.

  :title: Cost 'No. 1 Sustainability Challenge in 2014,' Ecova Says - Environmental
    Leader

    Water Management
    Cost is by far the biggest influencer of energy and sustainability initiatives; however, 2014 will be complicated by the anticipated increased energy and resource prices, according to an Ecova report.
    2014 Energy and Sustainability Predictions: Findings from Leading Professionals aggregates findings from a survey of about 500 energy and sustainability professionals, and reveals that 2014 will be a challenging year for those executives responsible for managing resources for their organizations.
    Companies face “unprecedented pressure” to cut costs, conserve resources and disclose environmental performance, says Jeff Heggedahl, Ecova president and CEO. These challenges mean firms must develop a total energy and sustainability management strategy to remain competitive and meet resource management needs.
    Water will emerge as a top energy and sustainability initiative, the report predicts . A majority of respondents (70 percent) noted that rising water costs are a concern for 2014. Water is also viewed as the second greatest area with opportunity for savings and improvement, behind energy.
    Also in 2014, new benchmarking regulations will create an increasingly complex environment, Ecova predicts. Thirty percent of respondents are unaware if their buildings are currently required or will be required to comply with municipal, city or state level regulations. However, among the 38 percent of respondents who are currently required or expect to be required to comply with municipal, city or state regulations, nearly 86 percent feel prepared to respond.
    Peer benchmarking represents an untapped opportunity. Twenty-seven percent of respondents acknowledged they didn’t know how their facilities performed in comparison to peers, and an additional 46 percent stated their buildings were performing only the same as or less efficiently than peers. This means that nearly 75 percent of respondents believe they have an opportunity to capture additional cost and energy savings compared to their current performance.
    In other 2014 predictions, Ford says while the world has been fixated on going green, now the attention is shifting beyond recycling and eco-chic living to a growing concern for the planet’s water. In the automaker’s 2014 Trends Report, Ford identifies this trend as “Sustainability Blues” and says forward-looking brands are already investing time and money into better water management practices.

  :title: Sustainability Professionals 'Needed Across All Industries' - Environmental
    Leader
  :text: |
    Sustainable Strategy & Leadership
    More companies are hiring  sustainability professionals, with the green goods and services field increasing 5 percent from 2010 to 2011 to reach 3.4 million workers, but there’s still considerable room to grow, according to a report published by the McGraw Hill Financial Global Institute.
    The report, Managing Organizational Sustainability: Demonstrating the Business Case for Sustainability Professionals in the Workplace, says there’s a need for sustainability workers across all industries.
    Written by authors from the Center for Green Schools at the US Green Building Council , the study says that a consensus has yet to be reached as to how sustainability staff should approach their work and evaluate their progress. 
    Sustainability officers take on complex and unique roles and responsibilities across functions and departments, the report says. The authors suggest that despite the complexity of the job, worker performance should be measured and tied to the company’s sustainability outcomes. 
    “Initiatives that align the business case with environmental performance are the holy grail of sustainability program success,” says Anisa Baldwin Metzger, who leads school district sustainability for the Center for Green Schools at USGBC and is one of the authors of the report.
    Commitment from upper management and access to top leadership is a key determining factor of sustainability performance, according to the report.
    The researchers also found that most organizations create sustainability programs as a result of direct or indirect pressures from suppliers, customers, shareholders, consumers, investors or regulators.
    A new initiative called Measure What Matters, led by the Green Economy Coalition, aims to bring greater alignment between corporate, national and global metrics of success to accelerate the transition to sustainable economies. The new project uses non-financial sustainability indicators as a benchmark rather than profit alone.

    Old Carolina BBQ franchisee takes lead on sustainability
    Parent Ichor Restaurant Group credits Todd Schafer with jumpstarting green practices
    Comments 0
    Old Carolina BBQ is focused on conserving energy, recycling fryer oil into biodiesel, and using recycled or sustainable building materials
    Fast-casual chain Old Carolina BBQ could reap cost savings and the “green” cachet that results from a greater focus on sustainability, and leaders of parent company Ichor Restaurant Group credit the enthusiasm of a franchisee for sowing that effort.
    Letting two-unit operator Todd Schafer take the lead in developing Old Carolina’s programs for conserving energy and operating more efficiently fits with Ichor’s goal of collaborating with franchisees, in the seven-year-old company’s quest to grow aggressively in the coming years, said Brian Bailey, co-founder of the North Canton, Ohio-based franchisor.

    “We’re in this together,” Bailey said. “We’re not in this business just to make royalties, we’re in this to build the brands.”
    The company’s brands include eight-unit Old Carolina BBQ; Smoke the Burger Joint, a new two-unit chain; and Baja PizzaFish, a single-unit fast-casual concept.
    Schafer, who operates an Old Carolina restaurant in Cleveland suburb Lyndhurst, Ohio, and opened his second location Sunday in Mentor, Ohio, strongly desired to adopt more environmentally friendly and sustainable practices for his restaurants, like conserving energy, recycling fryer oil into biodiesel, and using recycled or sustainable building materials.
    He received permission from Ichor to pursue those initiatives, including attaining LEED certification for the new building in Mentor, despite the franchisor not having plans of its own for aggressive sustainability.
    “We haven’t done this in our corporate stores yet, but we’re watching what he’s doing with it and guiding him with some of our suppliers,” Bailey said. “We hope to learn something from it and maybe adopt these things.”
    Schafer, who said he was encouraged to “run with it,” has reduced build-out costs for the Mentor location by 33 percent, compared with his first restaurant, using tactics like running all the utility lines through two common walls, cutting costs from furniture package, and building countertops from recycled rubber.
    In his first unit in Lyndhurst, he developed a “fire-on, fire-off” schedule of utilities to conserve energy used to operate the restaurants smokers, fryers and ovens, rather than leave everything running all day. The schedule led to a 50-percent reduction in the restaurant’s utility bill in the first month, Schafer said, and the procedure will be in place in Mentor from day one.
    With the Mentor restaurant now open, he plans to retrofit as much of the LEED-certified unit’s practices into the first location as possible before focusing on the next three Cleveland-area units he has agreed to open. Ichor might retrofit some of the features as well, Bailey said.
    Schafer said Ichor afforded him the flexibility to pursue his interest in sustainability not just because of his passion for the initiative but also because he wants to spread the practices to other franchisees that might join the company. He is working with Ichor to consult prospective franchisees on site selection and build-out.
    “I understood that in order for my store to be more successful, there needed to be more validity to the brand, which we can create with more franchisees,” Schafer said. “Making the brand more attractive by cutting costs for the operators, working one-on-one with the franchisor and along the way creating some brand loyalty with the things I’m doing, will make more people want to buy the franchise.”
    Bailey said Old Carolina’s next franchisee will open a restaurant in Ann Arbor, Mich., next year, and added that Ichor has received interest in Old Carolina and Smoke from operators in Michigan, Florida and Texas. Conservative plans are to double the number of Old Carolinas next year from eight to 16 units, likely with the help of forthcoming private-equity backing, he said.
    “We’re a company looking for partners that maybe don’t want to build across the country, but they want the Ichor brands to complement each other,” Bailey said. “There’s a lot of room to be successful between two units and 1,000, and we’re happy anywhere along the way.”
